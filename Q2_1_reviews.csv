KMCHvJp3TB-YWuPP7llNtg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"We came here on their first weekend of serving dinner and REALLY loved the food and cocktails, everything is so creative, tasty, and decently priced. Only knocked off one star because service was slowish but its a new restaurant and they have kinks to work out like all new restaurants do. I am sure everything will be up to snuff once they get their sea legs."
zeIabJSX22qTrNSjLMZA9w,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"The restaurant is fancy. It's quite a concept to substitute bread with bun. However, doesn't really fit my taste or expectation. The Cha Sui was cold, and the bun was dry. The portions were little, and the prices were little too high. I believe the owner may missed the real concept about BAO. What they serve are more like steamed bread with all kinds of toppings."
Z7K7ppLHrtEHJ5gsvvfTUQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Came here from recommendation by good friend. Initially wasn't planning on coming (gonna try good old Carl's drive in someday) but ended up coming here for happy hours. I am a Taiwanese and eat Baos all the time but this time I was impressed with the Bao. 

We tried the Chia Hsu Bao which my wife loved and I had the Wagyu small Bao which I liked but wasn't so impressed. The fries and the chicken wings however was the highlight....wow! The lemon flavor on the wings and th crispy fries really did it for us. I liked my cocktail ...very summer flavor. 

Loved the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant. Starting to like fusion food more and more now. Let's hope they keep up the standards. Gonna try soft shell next time!"
3v_CA8obx1z1s-2vityG0w,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Got the soft shell crab Bao and it was AMAZING!!! Always looking for new places to try and this did not disappoint. Highly recommend the soft shell crab. My boyfriend got the Wagyu Bao, he wasn't a huge fan of it. I thought it was good but the soft shell crab blew it out of the water. The only Real problem I had was I thought the cocktails were a bit pricey. 7$ for a mimosa. Couldn't pay that considering half of that is orange juice. Will def be going back for more food!!!"
mPKqwNy9XFoL7aKqWyWI9w,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,Came here on a Friday night and the place was not too busy my friend and I got a table right away. The server was a very nice gentleman who went over the drink list and menu for us. Gave us some recommendations. We ordered a few apps and shared some Baos. Over all the potsticker dumplings were the best I'd ever had in St. Louis. The baos were very good and not too doughy and thick. I would recommend coming to try something different and service was great the whole time. The staff was  very attentive
9_JHcWcOsw_Gf180Vqw7Qg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"The atmosphere was modern yet relaxed. I had the impossible burger. The bread and fusing a were good but I wasn't the biggest fan of the burger. This is likely because I'm a meat eater. The fries were great, skinny and crunchy. The dumplings were good although a bit on the salty side. I will definitely be back to try one of the more traditional baos."
R6gckJP0sKUuUcgYqUYBnQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Came here on a recommendation from a friend and wow- so glad we came! You jump in line to order and then get seated. Our food came out a little later than expected and mine came out wrong.  My boyfriend had the chicken katsu rice bowl and it was fantastic. Mine eventually came out like 10 or 15 minutes after my boyfriends food and it was much bigger than expected. I got the chicken teriyaki bao and it was phenomenal. Definitely don't need a side with it- it's huge. The bao is perfectly fluffy and so so good. We had the dumpling appetizer and it was also really good- about 8 dumplings crusted into a pancake type thing. I really like the atmosphere here, really modern and hip. Will definitely be back!

Food- 9/10
Price- 7/10
Service- 5/10"
3X4s22pAlpffCbznZnOVFw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,Very tasty and unique food in a cozy and pretty setting. Our waitress was friendly and informative. We will definitely go back!
XT7oXbbarCplUZm3QEatoA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Stumbled upon this place while a local festival was going on and was just hoping to get a snack and the baos I am familiar with were appetizer sized. 

So glad I stopped by this place because I HIGHLY recommend and will be back!!! This place specializes in baos but their baos are essentially burgers and one can definitely fill a person up. My boyfriend and I shared the char siu bbq gap and it was plenty! But the bao itself is AMAZING!!! The meat was so flavorful and juicy and the way they prepare the bao and the bread is so unique and different. Bao buns are usually soft and fluffy but I loved that they grilled the inside like a hamburger bun and it gave a nice crunch. 

The bao was also paired perfectly with cucumbers and cilantro and it was refreshing yet so flavorful. We also got their Korean street corn and thought these were just OK in my opinion. The addition of the bacon was a unique twist and added a great saltiness. It is also definitely worth because you get a lot of corn! But it was just OK and probably would not get again but would try something else off their menu. 

Overall, great trendy place in a great location. Was so surprised how good their baos were and they had some cute drinks on the menu too that I am dying to try. Excited to visit this place again and try more on their menu!"
AKEtBxUKCy4QzqsG5Lc2xA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"We went here for a double date. Place is super nice and has a great atmosphere. Food was good and The BAO wasn't small. We ordered a bunch of different things and shared it family style. We will be back to eat here again. 

Staff was nice and quick. Everything pretty much can out at once and we had to ask the table next to us if we can use apart of their table. I guess that would be my only complaint is how small the place is but that's Clayton..."
t1sNUxaU6P_tPyePQV8Caw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Trendy spot and great atmosphere! Our waiter made our visit so much fun! This place is also in a prime location with plenty of parking. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is I feel the prices are a bit pretentious. Great experience, decent food!"
FgO4tSsOUZPFg-i4oICIxw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Love the creativity and atmosphere, would certainly go for a professional lunch with during the work day. Service is fast, and its a nice bit of something different."
0HuYoNf15kNrZWzHHkrjHw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"A few friends came in town and of a list of St. Louis restaurants, The BAO was high on their list to try. We were pretty pleased with our decision. Around the table we ended up with two soft shell crab bao, one char siu, and one fried chicken, and a sizable container of shared fries. The soft shell was pretty tasty, however I'd probably try something else next time (and there will be a next time). We were unanimously disappointed when we saw a later table order the wagyu and realized it was basically a burger. Maybe we should have inferred that, but it would've been great if the menu were a little clearer. We also shared an ice cream sandwich for dessert. It was novel but nothing I'm dying to have again. Overall, it's a charming fun restaurant with good food, and we'll be returning."
mxyiMpL7RA7dSz-brC1btA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Happy hour is a MUST. Portions are small but cheap so you can try a variety of different things. We went with the dumplings, tofu yam bao, wagyu bao, and char siu fries. The tofu yam bao had a really good sauce and the wagyu bao tasted like a juicy burger with a bao bun. The char siu fries were to die for- not sure what kind of cheese they put on these but they melted in your mouth. The restaurant was empty which made the ambience kind of weird, but also made the service great. 4 stars because we went back another time when it wasn't happy hour and couldn't get the char siu fries. 

This isn't your typical asian restaurant, but that's why it's called asian fusion. Haven't had anything else like this in STL & will be returning for happy hour!"
2UxoUsda6kfdJAGsScDU5A,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"I had relatives in town from San Francisco and wanted to show them the newest restaurant in St. Louis that has been popping up all over my Instagram feed.  Bao did not disappoint.  Only advice when coming with a large group: all people must be present before being seated.

We came for lunch and ordered at the bar.  We were given a number for our table and found our seats.  When the food was ready, the server brought the food to our table (appetizers came out first) and the table number was taken away.  The coffee drinks, alcoholic beverages, and soda were brought as they were finished being made.  Our table was also given pitchers of water.

I ordered the bao lobster roll.  It was about 6 inches long, the bread was super soft and fluffy, the lobster was sweet and delicately dressed. A word of caution: because the bun is so fluffy, the lobster doesn't have a chance to nestle in deep.  I lost a piece of lobster to the floor :(  The dish came with a side of hot, well-seasoned shoestring fries in an adorably small pail.  I thought the price was a little high for the size of the roll, but you have to remember that St. Louis doesn't have local lobsters..."
piTzhHizTyLlgGeoshTglQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Arrived at around 6pm on a Saturday and was seated immediately as there were only a few tables taken.  The host, though, never told the server we were her table and we sat for a while.  The host and what appeared to be the food expediter chatted at the food window, not paying attention to our ""loneliness"".  
Finally, the host told the server that we were her table and she was rather loud in chastising him.  He didn't seem to be concerned.
She was great when she came to our table and described the menu to us.  We ordered two of their signature cocktails...delicious!  
The food we ordered was some of the best food we have had: a mushroom truffle bao appetiser, lobster bao, and wagyu bao.  Fantastic!
Unfortunately, the server didn't check back until we were done and no other drinks were offered or forthcoming.
The food outshines the service..but beware, our server seemed to be the only one taking care of the 15 tables by the time we left, the food expediter needs additional training, and the host needs to be concentrating on his highschool studies, not working in a restaurant."
LmbWpPYWyr6WPJYhjPWVJA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,Creative food options including pleasing vegan and vegetarian offerings along with an aspiring cocktail menu make this a good option for date night or family gatherings.  A few more gluten free options would be worth considering.  The flat board platings made the  runny fried egg yolks and other delicious overflowing components difficult to manage.
HC2MUsH-h8AoA1AcQt8JGA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"I came here one afternoon for a fairly late lunch ~3:00 PM and sat at a table by myself.  

I ordered the Soft Shell Crab Bao and thought it was awesome!  Really large piece of soft shell crab and good aioli sauce on it that paired really well with the crispiness of the crab.  The bao was soft and fluffy as I expected it to be for a Asian Bao dish.

I did the combo with the dumplings.  They were good but nothing too crazy or special and probably not worth the $5.00 for the extra dumplings.  The bao by itself was more than enough food.  They have lots of options and I would love to come again to try them all!"
czGb18OwqRy6klbW01vE2Q,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Very good and creative take on steamed buns. We love the mushroom, wagyu beef, and soft shell crab baos. These are all MUST-TRYS. Their rice meals are not as interesting but still very decent. Their desserts are also highly recommended - ice cream sandwiched by sweetened buns. Cocktail drinks are also a must-try. But why only 4 stars? Avoid the pork belly. It's not done well, it's soggy instead of crispy. Otherwise, we've always enjoyed coming back here for more baos!"
2pRlil3SZXBZEP7y07npdA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"First time having bao and this place definitely did not disappoint! Arrived with some friends expecting a happy hour menu, but upon our arrival we were greeted at the entrance with a very unfriendly woman. She started to tell us that the menu was changing and the person who told us happy hour started at 5pm did not have the authority to do so as they will not start happy hour until the following week. We decided to stay anyways and try out the food. Ordered fries & vegetable rolls for the table to share and was impressed with the fries! I decided on the shrimp tempura bao and added avocado to it, turned out to be one of the BEST dinners I've ever had! Tons of avocado, a handful of shrimp, a the fries come in a cute little pail. Overall, throughout our stay the waitress got better, but the food was !"
0oqihDpe2AgzE4XlelHzHA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,We ordered several appetizers to share. The pork belly stood out as my favorite. Service was wonderful and the atmosphere is very relaxing and upscale. The price was a little high for how much we ordered so I would go back for a special occasion but it wouldn't be a regular spot.
kMWyZHwN_vX2ssSDcjvIlw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"I am a huge fan of The BAO. The buns have the perfect level of squishiness to hold your meat, this was even after ordering them to go and eating them at home. They were able to stay fresh until we ate them at home. The soft shell crab bun was awesome. It had good amount of fry to it to were you had plenty of crab taste and it also had a very good amount of spiciness to it. The hot chicken and the beef were also really good buns. However, I was expecting a little more something from the pork belly bun, still good though. I think I was really craving some pork belly and the amount of pork belly and flavor of the pork belly just didn't hit the spot. The BAO is a spot I really want to continue to visit and keep making my way down the list of buns."
VBXVnmRCr--3A65sJSPcQw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Came here on a Friday at around 7 PM. It was pretty full, but we snagged a table just in time. It remained full but the turnover was pretty good, so I wouldn't worry about a wait time.

1) I loved the interior design; upscale, modern, even a little grungy. It was really great. 5/5
2) Customer service was amazing! 5/5
3) I loved the names of the cocktails, and they were pretty strong. I don't think I would have ordered what my boyfriend and I ordered again, but it was still fresh and delicious (we also really aren't cocktail people). They did have a decent selection of beer and wine! 4/5
4) Appetizers - the Laab wings and the Taiwanese dumpings were SO GOOD. I loved how they were plated. 5/5
5) We ordered the Char Siu and the Kakuni. The bao bun itself is delicious. I was a little disappointed in the sandwich as a whole. For how fatty pork belly is, I would have not added as much mayo as they did. The Char Siu was good, but it was missing more flavor - could have benefited from something pickled. 3/5

In conclusion, I will be coming back and trying the other baos. I really enjoyed my experience and hope they keep working on the menu to really perfect those flavors (maybe check out Chairman Bao, food truck in SF that serves AMAZING baos)."
BrNOs77RoLkj67jMg9HggA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Recently visited after seeing some beautiful photos of the food from the ""We Eat Stuff"" couple. I was super curious - it was my first bao bun experience. The restaurant is little, but I loved the ambiance. Very dim lighting with tables overly close together but with pretty decor and a nice bar.  It felt ""medium"" upscale inside which was great for date night. As I mentioned though, we were pretty close together which made it a little awkward when another party came in. 

Our server was nice and got everything to us promptly. We ordered the skinny fries and yum yum sauce as an appetizer. My significant other really enjoyed them. I found them too spicy - I'm a wimp about spiciness, but the menu didn't describe them as spicy so I was a little disappointed. The yum yum sauce was a little spicy too which surprised me because I've only had the ""regular"" kind before.

I got the Truffled Mushroom Bao. I'm a vegetarian and was happy to see multiple veggie bao options. The entire dish was very tall. It came out on a wooden block which made it easy to make a mess, but the plating was pretty. The mushroom was HUGE and it was breaded. The avocado tasted fresh and the gouda was a complementary touch. It was definitely difficult to eat, though - you are given a knife and chopsticks. I'm not great at using chopsticks but I'm pretty sure they weren't made for giant bao sandwiches. I figured it out though and used the chopsticks to hold down the bao and cut it into smaller bits.

Significant other got the Wagyu Beef Bao. He was torn between it and the other options that all looked great. He was happy with his choice and said the beef tasted quality and the egg worked really well with it. His portion was a little smaller than mine but he didn't complain.

We checked in on Facebook and got 10% off our order which was nice because the pricing is a little bit high for the portions. I'd like to see the entree prices reduced by maybe a dollar and some cocktail specials - those looked great but we didn't want to spend $10 or $12 per drink. The staff was super awesome and even saved my wallet for me behind the bar when I accidentally left it at the table. Overall a good experience and we would definitely return."
MkY6xHwPLJCXB64csFNYVg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Went here for a friends birthday. We had a reservation but it took them about 5 minutes to serve us water and provide the menus once they sat us. I think they were understaffed. But the food was reallllly good! The veggie potstickers were amazing. Skinny fries were good with the yum yum sauce, and I loved the beef bao. It was kind of like a burger. I got a glass of wine but my friend got mocttail and said it was delicious.l!"
WiiNy1ZkbS_f5FbI6ExVBQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Holy snikies this place...! Yum! Everything we had was spot on. The Thai soup was maybe the best soup I've ever had!  The dumplings looked amazing (but they weren't vegetarian ).  The sesame tofu was pretty good.  My tofu yam little bao was out of this world- the bun was such an amazing texture, as was the tofu- it was fried and crispy and complemented the moist bun amazingly, and there was some amazing sauce on there.  My only gripe is that I ate all the vegetarians stuff on the menu and I want to go back and try more things ( and eat some DUMPLINGS) but there wasn't a ton of options for veggies (but I am so glad there were a few things)... it's a very at forward menu.

Update: went back for a second time and I am less excited about this place.  The Thai soup was still amazing.  But the little bao was just ok.  The service was also realllllllly quite bad :/ I might come back for one more try but overall I'm not kinda bummed and don't know if I can recommend this place as highly as I had before."
cOQLzIeVo6568Fz-BAuUPQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,A little pricy and the waitress we had wasn't super friendly but the food is very good. Everything we ordered came out correct and it was all very tasty. Overall not a bad experience and the Wagyu beef bao was to die for. Nice setting and ambiance too.
1atq_l6hmkjIM_SzGwAuDQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Great experience. First time having been there yesterday evening so I was sort of at a loss as to what the whole BAO thing was and what to expect, the bartender Joe was more than happy to share his knowledge and insights about the whole menu.

Went with the Shishitos, the trio option, and Albatross and wasn't disappointed in any way. The food was well-made, clean, and in practically all cases had a sort of taste/cleanness similar to the Mandarin Variety of Asian cuisine.

A strongly recommended restaurant."
aDEu2TN5oGGpZ4mAayZCig,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Super tasty, but a bit overpriced. The fried chicken bao is one of the tastiest things, but basically everything here is delicious"
lLVYwuNlvz_rVOWc2u_o8g,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"The soft shell crab bao at this restaurant is the best sandwich I've ever had. It's absolutely delicious. The fries are also fantastic. The bowls are good too, but make sure you ask them to add a sauce to it because or else they are a little dry. The reason for the 4 stars is because there was a waitress being rude to the people at the table next to me. But the food was very enjoyable!"
cwE7fIh71Do3_zGt_6GPVg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"The bao were pricey but very yummy! Out of all the bao I really enjoyed the truffle wagyu the most. I would recommend getting the survivor bowl the amount of food is worth it. I loved their beef bowl! The beef were so tender, easy to eat, and flavorful. The downside is the price, the bao position side is small and it's pricey."
R7VajoZTABgER1bXvd_mzA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"For snacks, not for dinner or lunch. I love their skinny fries. Overall good food but I wouldn't come too often. I see a lots of ppl are complaning about the portion which I agree but also needs to understand the thr business owner's perpective"
CvW0QB2F-tTe0UkwYlu_RA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,Went to the Bao with my Daughter and her roommates a d I have to say that I am thrilled with the Bao.  The food was outstanding.  We started either pizza gyoza.  Looked like a pizza but instead of cheese cabbage on top with a delicious sweet and spicy sauce.  Let's just say it didn't last long.  Then came the crispy fries which preceded the main event the Bao.  I got the spicy lobster Bao which was so light and refreshing.  It was like a lobster roll on a Bao.  Loved it!  Then I had the Wagyu beef Bao which was surprisingly like a cheeseburger slider Bao.  It was good but not what I expected.  Then I had the Char Sui BBQ pork Bao which was fantastic and so delicate.  My Daughter tried the shrimp Bao which she devoured.  Her roomies also tried the fried chicken Bao which was enormous.  Great place with cool ambiance.  They dimmed the lights and it was cool.  I'd come back here again often if I lived here.  Service was excellent and friendly.  I highly recommend and look forward to returning to visit again.
n4TEW1iMJDypD03qESLcQg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,Really love everything about The Bao.  Unfortunately they made a silly change on the menu.  Every Asian restaurant in town serves pork potstickers.......the dumpling at The Bao was unique as they opened with delicious chicken dumplings which set them apart from the others.  There are many of us who do not eat meat other than fish or fowl and The Baos chicken dumplings were lovely. Am very sorry for the change.
ZXfgaKnN50ZfG8vvyxu9vw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Cheers to a new experience! I've driven past this place so many times and finally decided to give it a whirl. 
         When we were let in, we noticed that the occupancy was limited and tables were spaced quite far apart. We opted to eat at the bar. 
                 I got the veggie spring rolls as an appetizer and then the chicken katsu as my main. The  spring rolls were good and tasted how I expected them to taste. The chicken katsu was okay. I'll admit, it had curry in it so I wasn't sure what to expect. I wasn't wowed by it but did enjoy the taste of the chicken and rice. I ended up getting pretty full (shouldn't have gotten the app) so I didn't get to enjoy all that the dish has to offer. Service in general was fast and I'd like to come back to try more dishes. Overall, I'd give it a 7 out of 10."
Zc3apaz1UPIfVRoE_gycAQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Our order (2 1 bao combos) took over an hour to arrive, but the staff was kind enough to offer us fries (which were cold, limp, and soggy) and gyoza to hold us over. 

When the food finally arrived, it did not disappoint (except for the fries but based on our consolation fries from earlier that wasn't a surprise). They messed up my friends order so we ended up with an extra bao bun to try (the fried chicken) which was also delicious, along with the originally ordered soft shell crab and my order of the truffle wagyu. 

In my opinion the combo deal for one bao is not worth it (the fries were practically inedible compared to the delicious bao sandwiches). I'll definitely be back, but avoiding the fries since they aren't worth the plate space or money."
kKP0FcEWMHRyXt6CtVtKzA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"this place is a little pricey, but the food was really good. ambiance was nice & drinks were great"
zer6TdNxokMtj5CmXeF_yg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Overall nice place, good food. Nice atmosphere. Menu options were limited though on a Saturday night with no bao. I thought layout of the floor could be better. Expected fancy resteraunt but kind of felt more like a fancy take out."
LCZ13P3u8GyHNIHOdtoGFQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Not too bad! I enjoyed the Gyoza's & the spicy chili type sauce that went along with it! Wish that they had more than one server working. Overall, the restaurant experience was lovely! The atmosphere paired nicely with the meal!"
1lT7xpkW9F4dtJfLQ9dHEw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Ordered the lobster bao and soft shell crab, soft shell crab was solid 8/10, lobster bao probably 9/10. I also ordered the yuzu popcorn chicken. I thought it was gonna look like the photos, but then it turned up as a wet, sticky mess which tasted pretty bad. I don't know what happened but they need to change it back to whatever was on the picture posted by the business owner because it is misguiding and probably worse than the one on the picture. 3.5/5"
_KX-SXD1Lo6sgDCVxY6SIw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"I have tried the Bao twice now. Once for takeout and tonight with ISC and it falls into the I like a lot category. 

For takeout I ordered the Korean street corn and also the char sui Bao. The street corn is definitely something you want to eat when heart rather than let it get cold like I did unfortunately. Either way the taste as good it does come with big pieces of bacon which helps anything taste good.  The full-size Bao is a little dense on the bread but the flavoring of the pork was good overall about the size of a 5 ounce hamburger.

On our second visit, we ordered a few of the drinks. The ""coyote"" drink (can't remember the full name) was just the right amount of sweet and fruity without being overly so. This came with little mango Boba which was a nice little treat after the drink was done.
We ordered the Mofu Tofu which was extra firm tofu served cold with salmon roe and miso. Very yummy. 
Then we dined on the Laab wings!  Awesome!!!  These were hot and crispy and seasoned with a little vinegar and spice. Definitely with an Asian flare. 
Go for the little Bao sliders and get one of each. These were just right. Each with its own flavor not just different fillers. My favorite was the pork belly with the pickled greens. 
Overall the breading was sweet and soft. Done incorrectly the bun and get very hard and dry so thumbs up to the chef. 
This evening we missed out on the desserts so we will have to come back to try those out. They look very interesting with ice cream placed between fried Bao."
DFN1W9U-_QYrIh-lPaBBKg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Tasty food and a cute location - very convenient for an after-work happy hour. A little on the pricy side, but it's a great treat or special occasion."
_BzSPIpGXxj7pl-K7JARZw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"I've been on my birthday in June 2018 and then later in August of 2018. The menu does change a bit. The food quality didn't change! I did enjoy the Soft Shell Crab twice, a large platter of different meats (can't remember the name), and I've had a few of their drinks from their drink menu. It was awesome because one of the drinks had popping boba in it and it was delicious! Another drink that I can recall is one with a gummy shark and that was a strong drink! Also for desert, the ice cream bao was definitely a must! I liked the cold thickness of the ice cream and the crispy surprise that came from the bao!

I gave it a 4 star rating because my friend recently told me about his visit and it kind of made me change my views on the place. The food definitely isn't a concern, just with the management side of things.

Otherwise, it was pretty good!"
rWf-5GZv8Ssj-jEgWyHO9g,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Went here during Clayton Restaurant Week on weekday evening.  Loved the chill ambience.  Seated fairly quick.  We called several times to make a reservation but they would not pick up the phone.  Great cocktail from the bartender.  Enjoyed the mackerel, Thai dumplings, fried chicken Bao and waygu beef Bao.  Ice cream spring roll was just ok, would not recommend that.  Definitely would like to come back and try out the brunch or regular dinner menu."
IRIvq1EnPKMbCSm9EBn1cA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Outdoor seating! Everything is disposable so I felt really safe eating there during COVID. Like that they have carry out, as well. 

I got pork belly, the spicy chicken and wagyu beef boa buns. Pork belly was good, but I ate it last on a cooler day so wish I would have had that first and there was a bit more sear/crunch on the meat. The wagyu was super good on a fried boa bun, but really just a burger slider--not sure it was worth the up charge/higher price point. The fried hot chicken had the perfect crunch but I can't handle spice and this was SPICE. Got the massage Mayo to dip my fries in and could legit bathe in that or at the least eat it ok everything I'll ever eat again. 

Can't wait to go back to try some soups, noodles and other menu items!"
fMWUPfGbrBffOZDvYVfetQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Clayton is, perhaps, the nicest suburb of Saint Louis. The opening of The BAO, a couple of years ago, elevated the appeal of this suburban midwestern town for me. 

While the rice bowls make for a perfectly satisfying meal, the star items on the menu are the bao sandwiches. The pillowy buns, made with rice flour and milk powder, have a subtle sweetness that magnifies the flavors of the meats, especially the crispy and juicy fried chicken. The skinny fries are a perfect side item. 

To try an assortment of bao sandwiches, get a trio of bao sliders. Of course, there's no better way to end the meal than with a fried bao ice cream sandwich for dessert. 

If you drive to The BAO, there's a parking lot just behind the restaurant; there's an alley between the buildings to get to it."
i8jZMngg6URRibicCLMm5A,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Really tasty! Service was extremely slow, but to be fair they were working with a small staff and there may have been more online orders (it is Covid after all). The bao buns we tried were the fried chicken (really good), beef (also really good), shrimp (pretty good), teriyaki bacon (pretty good), and the spicy lobster (it was ok, not the best, which was surprising because we love lobster). The biggest drawback was that the food is a bit pricey so I wouldn't visit often, but I would definitely come back. Tip: order well in advance!"
CY1_Veco1JflT0KDuF-DFA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"I liked the look of the place and I really enjoyed the food. However, the fries weren't as hot as I would have liked them, but they had good flavor and were served with a Mayo type sauce on the side which I really liked. The spring rolls were crispy, warm, and served with a chili sauce, and overall really good! The buns itself were really delicious. The sliced beef was probably my favorite. It has a lot of good flavor. I wasn't thoroughly impressed with the chicken, but it was still decent. The wagyu bun was toasted more than the others which made it more crispy. The mushroom on that one really made it! I recommend coming here, but it is a little pricy!!"
t72vth3Rj6RqXkSuYBbeeg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,Pretty fun spot for a mid week dinner! The baos were great (our favorite was by far the crab) and fries were just okay. Will definitely be going back!
QfUSVkaOVjM549jCQjoevg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"Atmosphere: romantic, night out vibe. About 11 tables in the whole place. We went on the weekday and didn't have to wait, but i don't know  how busy it would be on the weekend so might want to make reservations do you don't have to wait. 
Food: my fiancé had soft shell crab bao--- really good, it is the whole crab (you will se legs). It's a sandwich and the bun was really good. it wasn't too spicy but very enjoyable. Wagyu Bao- is another sandwich that they had, at first i didn't really think it was going to be in burger form, i typically don't eat burgers but this one was really good and moist. Coconut soup-- HAVE TO GET, this soup was the best thing i ever tried. I can't even describe it, little coconut and very refreshing. 
Parking: street parking."
Tqy73PYJMaPY65_eRFgrRg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"This location has been on my food radar for a minute, and my friend and I decided to try it out. They gave you options to eat inside or out (with adequate space between tables). Wasn't crowded or too big. Our server was very polite, and we used the online menu provided by a QR Code given at the front table.  It's a pretty chill atmosphere, even with a bar across the street. I ordered Chicken gyoza, Pork Belly Bao, Shrimp Bao and Jasmine Green Tea Boba. They were all an experience and tasted good. The gyoza was cooked well. The fries were decent, a subtle compliment to the soft and flavorful bao. I will def try the other bao they have...as well as the pizza gyoza"
UWBTD_PVwgL-SWQ5w2E6Qw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,4.0,"We went to try the Bao on a Friday evening. We were told of a 30 minute wait by the host and we decided to wait. It turned out to be a longer wait but there was a table that was available that we could have been seated about midway into our wait. When the host came to tell us there was an opening at the bar, I asked about the table but was told it was being saved for a larger party and he would join two tables which was fine. But, a few minutes after we were seated, there was someone seated at that table with no joining of tables for a bigger group. This part of the night was annoying. I don't know what the deal was.

Once we were seated, the service was good and the food was delicious. We ordered a mocktail and one of their featured cocktails. They were both made well. For dinner, we got the sesame tofu, taiwanese dumplings, three little bao, and a soft shell crab bao. The flavors were delightful and the bao was light and fluffy. The waiter was great in recommending us things from the menu and the part of the evening where we eat and drink was very pleasant. The atmosphere was great. The decor and table settings were pleasing and romantic. We will return and I hope we have a better waiting experience next time."

While you should come for the Bao, you should stay for the drinks as well. As I told the bartender, I could drink their cocktails all day! Very tasty, interesting, and relaxing. 

All in all a great experience and I can't wait to go there again."

rUW964Bi3jBbNFv1jjyglA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"OMG, you must try this place! I dropped in for lunch not frequenting Clayton often so I didn't realize the restaurant is brand new. They were very busy at 11:30, but worked the crowd like pros. The food was refreshingly tasteful and quite filling for lunch. I tried the Koran corn with cheese and breaded mushroom bao sandwich. Both will be ordered again! The Bao buns are freshly made-reminds me of a large kolache bun. When you walk in, you write down your order, pay then sit. The bartender gave me a tip that if you plan to sit at the bar you can order and pay him to 'skip the line'. All the employees were extremely friendly. A manager checked on me twice and the owner stopped by to say hello as well. My entire dining experience, just a 'quick lunch break', was absolutely fantastic! I chatted with the bartenders a bit about their drink menu and am looking forward to scheduling a happy hour event at this lovely venue. The restaurant has a small footprint with a modern yet cozy atmosphere. I've dined at most restaurants in Clayton-this one has made my favorites list! They serve breakfast and lunch so if you are going for lunch on a work break, I suggest going early. It's tasty and unique. I'm sure this place will be packed and become a popular lunch favorite as more people try it."
ZhAmGUzcno4c9Lg10bHfmQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"I went to BAO a couple of weeks ago with a friend for the 1st time and can't say enough great things about this place. Everything was absolutely delectable. We went during happy hour and got some discounted appetizers and a cocktail to start. We had the Skinny fries, the Papaya salad and the Laab wings. All were delicious! My only recommendation is that the Papaya salad had a bit more lime as it was a touch sweet (but still delicious). We had the Tokyo Milk Dart which is a watermelon and cucumber infused soju cocktail and it was exquisite. Light and crisp with a really nice flavor. They didn't skimp on the booze either. For our main dishes we ordered the Softshell crab Bao and the Kakuni (braised pork belly and pickeled greens) Bao. OMG!!! These are definitely not your run of the mill Bao. The Softshell crab Bao...I'm drooling thinking about it now, was ridiculously good! So packed with flavor! The Mayo and eel sauce was so good on this Bao and I asked for more as I felt it needed just a touch more sauciness. This addition made this Bao perfection! I didn't think it could get any better until I took a bite of the pork belly bao, the Kakuni. It was like a flavor punch to my taste buds!  Wow! Each bite reminded of several different Asian dishes my mom used to make for us growing up and that is the highest of praise. I loved everything about Bao, the food, the cocktails, the amazingly elegant decor, and the extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff. I cannot wait to come back to Bao and try the other amazing looking dishes on the menu. If you haven't been here yet, you are missing out. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."
f62h5YebEGk-1-u5ZaLL6A,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Have already been twice since I moved in about 3 weeks ago. The service has been amazing both times I've gone. The happy hour deal is good especially if you're looking to try bao.

They were out of fries when I went, but still on my list to try when I go back. I have tried the wagyu, tofu, and pork belly bao. All of them were very very good. Definitely surprised about the quality of bao for Saint Louis.

Cheesy Korean corn is definitely really good as well. Not sure what makes it Korean exactly, but definitely delicious."
ZCL7KriPfqhHiNsheq67uw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Came here for brunch after Sunday morning workout, and there was space. The St. Paul Bao  was heavenly. Light, with a delicious aoili, tender near and fluffy Bao. The coconut soup was spiced with pepper oil , fresh mushrooms thin cut, and an order of fries. The manager said the kitchen had an extra order of wings, and the table next to us, who happened to be really nice, shared them with us. The wings were crispy, the best type of crispy, airy, a medium weight breading, full of flavor and inside was tender chicken, not at all oily."
2IJttVdOpOKzELu52m7oeA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"The Bao is an up and coming Asian influenced eatery and cocktail bar nestled in the heart of Clayton. I've been eating out around St. Louis for almost 10 years and Bao has achieved something phenomenal with a creative menu, a replete cocktail selection, and a mellow atmosphere to boot.

What makes Bao special is the combination of talent in the kitchen and behind the bar. Exec Chef RJ Xu and Chef Nisa York put in the time and energy to create a comprehensive menu that manages to stay familiar, honest, and humble with its interpretation of Asian cuisine. Ben Bauer and Matt Koch compliment the kitchen duo to offer us their expertise in crafting an exquisite and satisfying tiki plus classics plus international cocktail menu with over 100 selections, featuring unique ingredients and preparations found nowhere else in St. Louis.

I've eaten here both for lunch and dinner and the food pays an accurate homage to its international roots without trying to disingenuously ""elevate"" or ""exotify"" the experience. I have a lot to say about the food, but for the sake of brevity I'll talk about some things that stood out to me.

The breakfast baos (a twist on traditional beignets) were an instant hit for me and my partner. Simple fried buns dusted with matcha powdered sugar. Delectably crisp and sweet on the outside, with that warm fluffiness of 包 on the inside. I would love to snack on these all day.

The pork belly bowl reminded me intimately of something that I'd eat at home with several thick cut pieces of pork belly laid over rice and pickled vegetables and chili sauce on the side. The tasty cuts of pork had subtle hints of five spice, brown sugar, hoisin, ginger and was balanced well by the salty acidity of the vegetables. 

I also never thought I would enjoy having wagyu beef on a steamed bun with arugula, but damn do I like it now. Tasty on tasty on tasty. Simple and effective like so many things on the menu. Ordering these in addition to the chicken potstickers (also done extremely well with a measured crispness and aromaticity) was eminently satisfying. 

Everything was also seasoned to taste. I did not have a single menu item that felt under or over-seasoned. This seems like a basic thing to mention, but many restaurants get it wrong.

I rounded off the meal with two drinks off of the happy hour menu and were both fantastic. Potent and balanced. I can't remember their names, but I do love Fernet Branca and Pandan. My partner also enjoyed her cocktails which were similarly creative in flavor and execution. This place is perfect for someone that loves to imbibe. The bar staff at Bao is more than welcoming and knowledgeable to guide patrons through the 100+ selection on the menu.

P.S. Jess, you're awesome too!

I highly recommend The Bao for anyone living in or visiting St. Louis. It exists on its own in this town, flavor-wise and stylistically. Im looking forward to seeing it take off and become another staple institution of the St. Louis food scene."

The skinny fries with Thai chili aioli were great. I love thin fries, and the aioli was a perfect accompaniment. I had avocado toast made with toasted bao, avocado, and egg that was served with greens and tomato on the side. The dressing was light and tasty. Good mimosa. Everything was excellent. I also tried the Chicken Katsu bowl, which was delicious. The service was delightful and the food came out quickly. I would recommend trying it."
iArNFTBllQHGwEC04Bv0dw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Just finished an excellent carryout order for dinner. Very happy they're open for dinner now as it's outstanding. I dined for lunch a few weeks ago and the soup and Cantonese pork bao was excellent and unlike anything I've ever eaten. I thought the pork bao was a bit small compared to the teriyaki chicken bao the person I dined with ate. I was pleasantly surprised that the carryout order tonight was both superb and plentiful. My wife and I couldn't decide what won between the truffle shroom and the soft sell crab bao. Both were that great! Also the size of the sandwiches were large enough for one person while the Cantonese pork, was not enough for me (though great). I'm curious if maybe they've increased the size of the pork bao or if It's  just the style of that bao, as I would definitely order again if it's a bit larger?  Also, the larb wings were uncommonly good. What a outstanding and unique addition to St. Louis!"
22nwf1XhRv5ZBmoSNAfnjw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,Classy decor and delicious food! I would come again and again until I've sampled all of their baos. Loved the duck dish too. The only thing I'd say that not wholly positive is that I wished the portion size were bigger cuz the food is so delicious.

The dumplings looked amazing (but they weren't vegetarian ).  The sesame tofu was pretty good.  My tofu yam little bao was out of this world- the bun was such an amazing texture, as was the tofu- it was fried and crispy and complemented the moist bun amazingly, and there was some amazing sauce on there.  My only gripe is that I ate all the vegetarians stuff on the menu and I want to go back and try more things ( and eat some DUMPLINGS) but there wasn't a ton of options for veggies (but I am so glad there were a few things)... it's a very meat forward menu."

Lunch portabella bun was hearty and filling with a great combination of flavors. The tiny bucket of skinny fries with the bun was a nice touch. 

At dinner, we ordered the papaya salad, dumplings, and street corn for starters. The papaya salad wasn't too spicy like it's served many places in stl.  Dinner dumplings were incredible and I could've used the sauce on everything. Our table raved about the street corn.  I ordered the crispy duck as an entree and loved it. Crispy skin, tender duck, just enough heat in the sauce to give it a nice kick and great flavor. 

Staff was accommodating and friendly. We will definitely return."

I got it as a lunch set, so also had iced tea and 3 Thai dumplings that were DIVINE!  In looking over their menu, there are many different things I'd love to try, like their cocktails and Guava Chili Cider (what's THAT???)!  Knowing that I'd be driving in bad weather kept me from getting as adventuresome as I'd have like to been.  And the name of the place is Bao, but I didn't have a Bao!  Next time!!!"

But after a full meal, fries for the appetizer, BAO burgers for the entree, and a classic cocktail to drink - everything is AMAZING. Absolutely incredible. The Skinny Fries and yum yum sauce are so delicious. I had the little BBQ bao burger and my husband had the large beef bao burger and both were so good! 
Their bar was great too! We split a Jack Rose that was tasty! 
We will be back here for the lunch specials for sure!"
AwK9r-rojLn1GTVgzx7nHw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,They're foods unreal. I ordered it so many times on postmates and finally decided to check the place out in person and was astonished. The ambiance was awesome. It was such a great place for date night. Had a very upscale feel and their drink menu was so extensive and had so many options for hand crafted drinks! Love it. Love it.

yx7opMldbYT5Y2Ff0faZhw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"My sister & I went in for lunch, and we LOVED IT!!! We felt a bit underdressed but maybe it was because people were on their lunch from offices near the area lol. We got the fries, Korean street corn, wagyu & mushroom bao/burgers, and they were so good!! Especially the mushroom burger. I didn't think I'd enjoy a non-meat burger, but this was seriously.... wow. I shed a tear or two. A few reviews I read said the portions are small, but (as someone who eats a LOT) I didn't think they were. & the restaurant itself is super clean & modern & cute. Pretty easy to find street parking. Definitely will be back."
2PtqKoioksoIOqhppYD5mw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"This place is the bomb dot com. The atmosphere is awesome and the food is even better- it's creative, satisfying, and just plain delicious. 

When my husband and I went at lunch time, we ordered at the register and then they brought our food to us (not sure if it's like this at dinner time too). I actually really like this system, especially at lunch, because it speeds things along since you don't have to wait for your check at the end of your meal. We had Moscow mules to drink, which were great. 

Now for the food! So far we've tried the fried chicken, the wagyu, and the lobster roll- all were delicious. The fried chicken is probably my favorite- it was not at all greasy and incredibly crispy. Speaking of crispy, omg the fries- SO insanely good. The dipping sauce is also on point- it's just a little bit spicy, but not too much so. Each bao comes with a small portion of fries, but in my opinion it's not quite enough, so I recommend ordering an extra side (especially if you're with more than one other person). The Korean street corn was also delicious- it was so savory and had a great combination of flavors. The menu overall is creative but approachable, and I can't wait to try more of their options. Plus, the prices and portion sizes are just right. 

To top it all off, even the bathrooms were super nice. They were stocked with little essentials like floss picks and tampons- how great is that? I don't remember the last time I saw a restaurant anywhere that did that. One minor disappointment: there was no changing table in either bathroom. There was a bench in the ladies room, but it had slats in it so it didn't look like the best place to change a diaper. I notice these things now that we have a 9-month-old! Speaking of him, he really enjoyed the food here too, btw (although to be fair, he eats anything and everything).

I can't recommend this place more highly. I think it's one of the best new places to open in St. Louis in a while and it's such an awesome addition to Clayton. I'm sure we will back many times!"
daqVu8tpHT6qDfeG4JoEFA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"The BAO took great care of my group when we visited for dinner last week! We had a thoroughly enjoyable experience, from service, to atmosphere, to food and drink. I chose this place because my friends had all been enthusiastic about it, even though I wasn't as much because of the vegetarian options (which they have, but didn't appeal much to me). I am happy to say that I had a great meal! 

First, our service was great! Our service was very nice and friendly. He was knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The atmosphere was upscale but not too much. We were able to sit comfortable at our table and also use some lounge areas as we mixed up to socialize, since we had a party of 15. 

My drinks were amazing. One of the most original cocktails I've ever had was called ""An Uneasy Partnership of Coyotes,"" and desribed as
""Yuzu Calpis, Vodka, Mango Boba."" I had no idea what yuzu calpis was but they had me at mango boba. It ended up being a yogurt based soda that was so good! The mango boba (popping variety) added a sweet explosion to many sips. It was amazing. I would have had 5 if I hadn't been driving, so I had to stick to 2. I had the skinny fries to start, which they usually don't serve at dinner but they made for me after hearing I was looking forward to them. They were seasoned nicely and had a yummy dipping sauce. I got 3 of the mini bao for my meal, the ones with tempura tofu and yam. They were the bomb! The perfect combination of sweet, crunchy, and savory. I was blown away. The ice cream bao looked awesome, but I didn't try it this time. I will next time, and there will be a next time for sure!"
v1PSbNVwVD8GYBVtID86rQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Great spot for lunch in Clayton! I recommend the Korean street corn, dumplings, soft shell crab bao, and the portabella bao. It's an order at the counter and sit down type of place (at least for lunch) so definitely a more casual setting! Oh, and the fries are also yummy!"
XUfykj13QwM_z_dMbB_zjA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"I was so tempted to give BAO 1 star because it's my absolute favorite restaurant in St. Louis, and I don't want the secret to get out! But I couldn't bring myself to do it. Get the ice cream bao. Get the seared mackarel. Get everything!"
ygkCvXcAV1Q4apwEHussXw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"I thought this place was really cute.  The atmosphere was inviting and our server was quite amazing...  very knowledgeable.  She actually looked like Mays from Lucifer...  anyway....the food was different and interesting, in a good way. We tried to go back last week but they were closed ...  it was a Sunday.  I don't remember them being very expensive and the drinks were tasty...  not weak.
Good place for a casual date.  Great location.  Trendy!"
8xCvVeXflPiRTySd-NlevA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Wow. I am blown away by The Bao. I went yesterday with expectations that it would be good but not THIS good. 

The restaurant is beautiful and the bartender who took our order was extremely helpful in selecting our food. 

I got the Char Siu Bao and my girlfriend got the Fried Chicken Bao. The Char Siu was cooked perfectly with crispy but moist pork while my girlfriend's Fried Chicken was an amazing concoction of flavor. 

I will be back very soon."
JzibzOCsiF_50tdY7aRrvA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"I had my first bao experience at The Bao and sweet lord of the bao, I'm in love! I went with the soft shell crab bao per my server's recommendation and it was perfect. The bao was so soft, and the crab was cooked so well. It was served with a cute little bucket of fries -the bao was huge so you don't need a ton! They had some kind of magical lemon zesty seasoning on them and were delicious. I'm excited to come back with a group so that I can try some of there sides & different baos!"
8sh_0r2btU5exwMMNGnhCQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,This place is amazing! They have an open indoor atmosphere and a small outdoor patio as well. The lobster roll is the best one I have had in St. Louis and you can't beat the price or the service! Highly recommend it.
sdxG1SnNWZRGjx-vgXViow,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"I absolutely LOVED this place. The atmosphere is so cozy and the music was great. Staff could not have been nicer from the second we walked in.  I got the St. Paul Bao, it was soooooo yummy. My friend got the soft shell crab Bao and hers was also amazing. Needless to say, I will be back very soon!! Try something something outside of the box!!!"
q7BDJAaVGWbvF_8nxY_Ysw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Excellent lunch option, without a big lunch crowd. The fries and yum yum sauce are amazing, could easily be worth the visit alone. The Wyagu Bao was an interesting use of such beef (ground patty) but was delicious. Especially with some yum yum sauce added. The only minor issues is actually getting it in your mouth- the 3 patties make a challenge and the delicious egg goes everywhere, but it's well worth the effort. Chill lunch atmosphere."
HC_ZwbKbECdD2nLGchT3ng,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Had the Black Garlic burger, wings, and katsu bowl.... definitely a must try.  This place was addicting, the Bao sauce was incredible.  Would highly recommend anyone wanting an asian fusion.  10/10 Forsure will be back!"
bZl4Mgupqg5G-Ii7lwBxcA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"This is a great new addition to my increasingly amazing foodie city. I've been spying good reviews and have been curious to try this place and it just worked out tonight that we wanted to go out to dinner in Clayton on our way to run some other errands. FIrst of all - this is a gorgeous space. There are a lot of details from wall decor, the upholstery, the tile underneath the bar that just make it super classy looking, but yet still relaxed which I definitely appreciate. 

We had great service tonight too and were greeted very quickly when we entered. I appreciated that the server asked us if it was our first visit, and when we said yes she took the time to introduce the menu and tell us about a few of her favorites. I personally love when restaurants do this because I like so many different things I have a hard time choosing off a menu and want to hear what they are proud of and excited about. 

I went with the korean street corn and soft shell crab bao based off her recommendations and they did not disappoint. I'm from Maryland and definitely appreciate a good softshell crab sandwich, which is essentially what the bao is just with some added umami notes and obviously on bao. I'd say get it now while it's hot because softshell crab is pretty seasonal so they may not be able to keep it on the menu for long. My husband tried a more traditional bao, the char siu which is a BBQ pork and he also enjoyed. I wasn't super hungry so a bao for each of us and splitting the street corn hit the spot. 

While we did not partake in alcohol tonight the cocktail menu looked pretty inventive and is probably worth exploring on another visit. They also were advertising a happy hour on a sidewalk board which  might be a good opportunity for that. 

The Bao is a local business doing a good thing right and makes me happy. You should let it make you happy too."
xml1xw2Hmx8wY_ASAEnHvQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"The BAO is a great addition to the St Louis food scene. I took a group here for a work lunch and everyone was very pleased with their lunches. The lunch sized BAO ""sandwiches"" are quite large but come a la cart. We also split a few orders of their fries and would definitely recommend those as well. 

I look forward to returning for lunch and for dinner"
v4agCcoLrU5VKWTZoCEoGw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,Where do I start? The atmosphere is laid back. It is small and intimate. The food was fresh from the avocado and crab dish to the the crispy duck bao. The food was very flavorful. The fries were so delicious with a seasoning that makes you keep going back for more.
N1nYpvBUwVynVzPmwpY-Ig,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"I fell head over heels in love with the Crispy Chicken Bao, the Lobster Roll, and The Massaman Curry from The BAO @thebaostl . Gone are the days of tiny baos, the peeps here served up hungry-man sized portions only. Keep this in mind when ordering. The buns are made in-house, and believe me when I say, this really is a game changer. They have super soft and spongy texture, and just enough sweetness to offset the savory flavors of what go in between them. I was really surprised to find the curry dish on their menu. I was expecting much, but man oh man, it was DELICIOUS!! The lobster roll was beautifully prepared, and the flavors was absolutely on point. This is our last meal in St. Louis before heading to Arizona a few weeks ago, and my little monkey  @viphantastic couldn't be happier that we stumbled upon this gem. **Side note: kudos to the peeps here for the gorgeous menu. I love the simple design. As a foodie, I always eat with my eyes first, and these peeps really know how to take eye pleasing photos of their dishes for sure. Yes, I'm in menu envy mode.   Menu goals for sure**"
ASQ1emvRNB-U49r1E9kX6w,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"This week is Clayton restaurant week, so their menu and our experience may be a little different than the norm. We were give the option to participate in their special- which was a 3 course meal for $25, or sit at the bar and pick something a la carte. We decided to pick a la carte because we weren't sold on the desserts. 

This place blew my mind! It was amazing. Even though we sat at the bar, It was spacious and we were well taken care off. As an appetizer, we had the Korean street corn. It was flavorful, a little sweet, cheesy and so delicious. We were also considering the dumplings, since the bartender suggested it, but I'm really happy with our choice.

As the entree, I had the truffled Mushroom Bao- It was a lot bigger than what I imagined. The mushroom was breaded, which was a little unexpected but I loved It. We also had the crispy chicken Bao, which I don't think is on the regular menu ( i think there's a teriyaki chicken but it's not the same). The chicken was flavorful, the boa was sweet and fluffy! I have no complains. I really can't wait to come back and try some other menu items because i truly wanted to try them all."
EP3kjYk8tytjDDc21I4jgg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"So good, a sweet little secret! Food is so good! Great staff. Try their lobster bao it's delicious !We've been back many times and love it every time."
PZ5Vg0NPnxSYDZnaSaDYng,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"So insanely grateful I chose the Bao for my post-graduation dinner for 22 people!!! This was my second time here and the staff were fantastic no matter if our party was 3 people or 22 people. They have a small, intimate venue so if you're going to reserve for this many people, definitely get it started more than a week out. Kira, the manager, stayed in contact with me over the course of about a week and helped out so much with the menu selection and finalizing all details. (We ordered in bulk using catering prices and did family style). We even had one person with a vegetarian diet and peanut intolerance who was easily accommodated. 

The food is Asian fusion and my family and I LOVED it. My advice for ordering is that if you go to a restaurant called Bao of course you HAVE to try their bao sandwiches. Pork Belly, Fried Chicken, and Impossible were our favorites. There's so much flavor packed in those little bun sandwiches!! Another favorite dish of ours was the sesame chicken wings dish. And the Bao Beignets too! The one table of ours that got the eggplant dish raved about it. Their cocktail menu is very unique, but has something for everyone. The servers are super good at helping you pick a drink according to your tastes. 

Finally, look at this menu that they had for us!  It was so personalized and cute!! Thank you so much to Kira, Chef Brandon, and rest of the awesome staff for accommodating our large group and doing it with such friendly attitudes!!! It was such a success. :)"
Cx-C_td4rWnzw2dpZIswow,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,My husband wanted me to try this place for lunch since he had it a few days prior and loved it. I see why. The people are genuinely nice and the food was excellent. Everything on the menu is a hit! (I was with a group and we pretty much had one of everything) glad to have his place so close to home!
OxPg__3nABKmV_d0OITN7g,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"A little pricey considering the BAO's are small, but well worth it! Love the different options. I had the crab, lobster, wagyu and fried chicken, it also came with fries and an incredible aoli. If you've never had a BAO (I hadn't), it's the type of bun and it's made from steamed lotus leaves. It creates a delicious texture which is even better with their ingredients. Will definitely return, and would highly recommend."
ty_BXFf3jC4zaOiSw_RuYw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Atmosphere is minimalist but elegant. Service was great. We had a delicious dinner. I had a great cocktail, and we slit the pan fried pork dumplings (so good!). My husband got the Massaman Curry and he liked it but said it was VERY spicy. I had the truffled mushroom bao and it was scrumptious. Will definitely be back!"
vyWTN_s05SX8_cq0Tua7Jg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Been here twice now and it does not disappoint! The cocktails are the real deal. They have an entire book of around 100 cocktails to choose from and the staff are happy to help you pick one out. Every drink I've had here has been 5 stars. The food is pretty good as well, maybe 4 stars overall. It's a bit pricy and I think it's hard to know how much to order with the share-ables. Some of the food has been delicious, some of it is just ok and feels like it's trying too hard. Overall, happy to have this place nearby to get a nice drink and snack at."
HwoaJqdfhFrOC1DSjaQPAw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,When someone suggested we meet at The BAO for lunch I didn't know what to expect. I arrived early and checked out the menu posted in the window. It seemed interesting and I could not wait to give it a try. I am really glad I did. Great place. Our order did get delayed for some reason. I think there was a mixup at the counter. All ended well. I can't wait to go back.
bY1MwJCekflUSCjsoFd6mQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,Some of the best food I've ever had in Saint Louis! Definitely will be coming back and telling everyone I know about BAO.
mC1xzPzkI5sEJmbyeRuGTQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Still incredible. Today we tried grapefruit SoJu, sakerita, and sake. Everything from service to udon noodle bowls was absolutely perfect. We were so delighted to finally meet the owner and again have our wonderful server, Amy! 10/10 will return."
xRdAn0tPH-54MX06OR1dOw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Great food and drinks. Definitely go for a mixed drink/cocktail there over anything else. The mushroom bao is my favorite, don't be fooled, it's a lot."
9LSqkFLYgRumXVtKIxI_fg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Food: 5 Stars
Service: 5 Stars

What Worked: I can't tell you how much I love and appreciate when restaurants take the time on decor and do it well. I love the bold colors, the different textures, and the hint of romantic flair. While the space is open and airy, it feels intimate and private and makes a huge difference when dining out. 

Aside from the decor, the food was phenomenal. I love their concept of using the bao bun in lieu of the typical burger bun or brioche bun. The bao bun brings a softer texture and sweeter taste to the plate.

Soft Shell Crab Bao: This guy arrived whole and not in pieces. Super crispy on the outside while flaky on the inside. Eel sauce and mayo provided some smokiness and a hint of tang. Really impressed with this show-stopper. Be sure to try this!

Wagyu Bao: Although I've had wagyu burgers in the past, I felt this dish deserved some recognition due to the fresh ingredients and high quality wagyu. Just be prepared to get messy... (the messier the food, the better it tastes, no?)

Char Siu Bao: Crisp. Savory. Clean. I don't know how else to describe this... just try it.

Taiwanese Dumpling: I've been eating dumplings all my life, in fact, my mother should have just named me ""Dumpling"" for my infatuation with them. However, I've never craved dumplings like I crave these Taiwanese Dumplings. I don't know why or what's in them to cause this kind of reaction (stuff them with unicorn dust?) but they're comforting and savory and I really love the crispy edges. It's such a simple dish with simple ingredients, but some times simplicity makes the best dish. 

What Didn't: Korean Street Corn. I love the starchiness of Korean Corn, but this dish was just too dry and starchy for me. (I did enjoy all the glorious melty mozzarella on top, though!)

The SuperStar: Sesame Mofu. OH.MY.GOD. Fresh. Clean. Silky smooth. This simple plate brought on such complex emotions within me but all I could do was smile and hope that other people at my table wouldn't reach over and ask to try some. The gold is in the sesame dressing. I loved the way it delicately hugged each tofu slice. I may have to move to Clayton just for this dish... 

Thanks for the great experience, I'll definitely be back for more!"
0hzrNph1KkbLyL5gYYW74A,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Nice little restaurant in Clayton! Very cozy and great for quick bite! 

The bao was very good, we also ordered skinny fries and they are fresh off the fryer! Great crispy on the outside, what can I say that aioli dip was amazing, sweet and spicy brings a perfect balance. We also tried the Korean street corn! That's worth a try, mix it with the aioli for a perfect match! Eat while it's hot! 

Definitely comming back here! This is a great spot for a first date. 

Ohh btw. Free coffee on Mondays! Service is also amazing keep it up! I love that they leave a water bottle for you to refill on your own! Only thing I want to suggest is to provide Ice. But everything is amazing.

zBAHoGC9Zas_70BVJ3MrYA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"We moved to St. Louis last year from NYC and have had mixed results with various Asian cuisines here. We finally tried The Bao for takeout last night and were really impressed. I got the chicken katsu curry which was excellent - the curry is full of flavor and the chicken was crispy and hot, even after me driving it home. We shared the fries, really good, and several bao buns. The buns are so good, pretty much the same level of quality we'd get in New York. Unlike some smug reviewer below who suggested they use ""a brioche bun"", we loved the buns. That reviewer clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. If you want a brioche bun, go to a burger place. That's like me getting ramen and saying I wish they'd use spaghetti noodles lol. Anyway, if you like steamed buns, The Bao makes great ones. Add some Nashville hot fried chicken and spicy mayo to it and you've got an incredible little sandwich (not that little, though, the portions are good size). 

On top of the excellent food, they were fast, extremely friendly, and brought the food out to my car. We will be back, probably gonna have to make this a weekly habit. It's the best Asian/Asian inspired cuisine I've found so far in STL. Thanks Bao!"
p-FHa6ngIJVixPkuXipmQg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Great food. I am from Japan and pretty picky for Asian food but this place is very high standard Asian fusion!!!
Portion is quite large so kids could share a dish.
Wagyubao is a must."
QcXqp5JGnIdNJo1c1NmtfQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Be still my beating heart. I may have found a new love. I've discovered a restaurant that has three of my favorites and they do them all well. I'm besides myself with excitement and can't wait to tell you about it. 

My inaugural  visit here was with the ISC (International Super Club). As my usual, I arrived early. This gives me an opportunity to relax at the bar before all the members arrive. Tonight I started out with one of their signature adult beverages.  One of my favorites is a Manhattan,  which we will talk about later.  However, their Heartbreak and Setbacks is kinda similar, so that is where I begun. The. Bonded Rye was smooth and being served on the rocks made a refreshing cocktail. 

 As I enjoyed my cocktail,  I munched on their Crab Avacado.  Once you have enjoyed this appetizer, it will be hard to go back to regular guacamole.  It's a smooth blend of avocado,tomato,onion and cilantro.   Then it is topped with shredded crab meat and served with lotus root chips. It's the perfect nosh while sipping a cocktail. 

Somehow my H&S was gone before the appetizer and I needed a second adult beverage. For my next cocktail, I went with my favorite, a Manhattan. To test the masterfully skills of a barkeep, I take mine up. She nailed it. Happy boozer, here. 

As our members arrived, we moved to our tables. Here I started out with another of my favorites, chicken wings. They were served crispy and the mix of lemongrass and Thai Chili, was a delicious mix of tangy and heat.

Before I could order my entree, Stevie needed another cocktail. #3 would be an Old Fasioned. Again, the young barkeep nailed it. It's good to see that in addition to being creative in mixing and creating new cocktails, they are still mastering the classics.  

 Finally, the piece of resistance of the whole night was the Bao Soft Shell Crab.  Soft shell crab is not only one of my favorites it is one of my weaknessess.  Whenever I see it on the menu it is a must have.  This is the first time I have had it on a bao  and I can honestly say it will not be the last.  I was expecting the softshell crab to be in pieces, but to my surprise it was one entire crab placed between the bao. I first enjoyed eating my way around the bao, experiencing the delicious soft shell crab. Then I ate the bao getting the full experience of the; eel sauce, masago, kaware and mayo. That is when I said, be still my beating heart. I was in love. 

 The ambience is extremely comfortable and modern. Their service is detailed, friendly and professional.  A combination that provides you a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience. 

I'll be back? - Hell, yes.  They've got three of my favorites.

When - June 21, 2018
Why - International Supper Club"
T918943USkBI60Gz1P-gdg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,Wonderful taste of freshness and detailed presentation. Got the three bao plate Which comes with french fries. The pork belly was absolutely delicious as was the spicy beef. Each sandwich is a treat.  Got to dine in and they did a really nice job keeping everything clean and distanced. I can't wait until this place gets up and running because it's really beautiful interior space with a great looking bar. Definitely going to come again and try out the menu in-depth.
vmUe0sgG1xt9cs6s1It80Q,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,We obviously got this to go cuz you know the Rona. They had an awesome and fast to go process. It was about a twenty minute drive home and the food smelled amazing the whole way back. I was pleasantly surprised still pretty warm and fresh when we got back. We got 4 bao burgers with an order of fries and potstickers. The fries nothing special but I was glad to see their skinny fries were normal size fries. The potstickers were pretty good. The spicy lobster was not very spicy but still good. The waygu beef was amazing. I would recommend that as a must have. Honestly take out has been hit and miss for the last year but this place easily in my top five.
Pdvb5tfYtXEdzfVzpVCvDA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Got the crispy shrimp bao and the beef udon with Szechuan broth. It did not disappointed! Crunchy bite into the crab bao was so satisfying and the udon noodles were perfect, the beef was tender and savory, and the broth was flavorful and had a nice kick"
2wQeH70fjHoAGDuQuIT5WA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"WOW just wow, I loved going to this place. Super condensed menu, but everything was just amazing. It is rare for me to say this about any restaurant, but the food was good and the drinks were STRONG. Shout out to our waiters Tyga (spelling..?) and Kristen, both were wonderful!
The Wagyu burger was an absolute delight! Not too salty and the bun was lime a nice soft fluffy cloud. The texture is soft, not like a traditional hamburger bun. The egg was nice and runny and it was all a match made in heaven. The meat was perfectly portioned for the right amount of saltiness. This comes in both a small and larger size!
The Tofu Yam Bao: I don't know what type of sauce was on this but MUST TRY. Tried to the perfect crispiness, paired with the soft bun. Perfect for an appetizer. Get it on the happy hour!
Laab wings: these have a surprising lemon kick to them. Not super crispy, more on the saucy side. Not as impactful as the Tofu or Wagyu, but still super tasty. 
The drinks are VERY STRONG HERE so you for sure get what you pay for."
chXuFgSmBoHqCDeZt8OsGg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"The best pork belly in town, so tender it fell apart. Amazing food, and even more amazing people."
pljb5IruhXxrhZhMWQq33g,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"I really enjoyed my first time at Bao with the International Supper Club (ISC). Thanks to Picha for the recommendation and for Sarah S. for making it happen!

I've been eating Chinese bao for a long time... probably ever since my baby teeth came in. So I was very familiar with the food, but I knew that The BAO puts a twist on the traditional bao. I wasn't sure what to expect or whether or not I would like it.

For appetizers, my spouse and I split the Taiwanese Dumplings, which were perfectly pan fried and very tasty. I probably could've eaten mulitple orders of these for dinner and I'd be happy. For the bao, I had the Soft Shell Crab. I really enjoyed the bao, pretty typical fried soft shell crab, nothing special in my book. I did like how the sweetness of the bread and mayo balanced out the bitterness of the arugula. I also had a bite of the Truffle Shroom bao, which was HUGE and really good. The gouda went well stuffed in the panko crusted portabello. For dessert, we had the black sesame ice cream bao. This was basically a small donut cut in half with ice cream in the middle. How could this be remotely bad?

I'd definitely recommend you check this place out if you are looking for Asian cuisine with a twist."
s2EGe3l6kQaI-WsAXLJPuQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"I had the papaya salad & truffle shroom Bao. It was un-REAL. By far the best food I've had in a LONG time. It was decadent, but not too heavy like I'd feel after a regular cheeseburger. The environment was super lowkey. The chill, low-fo beats set a really good vibe for the experience. 
I can't wait to try more of the menu."
30O0Cox8MiPnCw-yco9toA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,This place is a dream. We got a few Bao sandwiches and each bite was delicious and melted in your mouth.
OWINsvD98JKvhyaQroMc-Q,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"This place was an incredible surprise! I've had bao at Chinese restaurants before and I'm not that enamored with it. We received a gift card to this place and found the food to be delightfully creative. It is the ultimate fusion cuisine. The flavors were unbelievably unique and delicious. We will return often! Our meal was carry out but I'll bet it is even better when you eat in the restaurant. Either way, my entire family loves this place."
NCtmYXz-GISpiofQ2yj1dg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Go here now!  Get some bao!  That's really all you need to know!

More details?  Sure.

We went here for the first time with the International Supper Club - an ad-hoc group of Yelpers who enjoy trying cuisines from other countries.  

Bao are buns.  We had a discussion at the table about what makes them unique but we never got to the bottom of it.  I did a little research before sitting down to write this review and the answer is that it is a relatively standard dough that is steamed instead of baked.  When the restaurant griddles them lightly they pick up an even more unique combination of flavors and textures.

I ordered a couple of appetizers: dumplings and wings.  Both were quite good but the wings were the more unique of the two.  Think of wings that are coated in a bunch of less common ingredients like lemongrass and rice powder and you're on the right track.

I chose the three little bao for dinner and they came out on a small wooden cutting board.  The first one I grabbed turned out to be my favorite - it was stuffed with tempura-fried slices of tofu and yam then topped with a house-made sauce and a few leaves of cilantro.  Next up was the pork belly, followed by the waygu beef.  Odd as it seems, the first one remained my favorite by a long shot.  I also snagged a bite of the kids' char siu bao and they were something I could see myself ordering on a future visit."
xSVQcNeYVGvO-A4VEUCSmQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"OMG. In town for a wedding and found this place.  What a find. Everything was amazing.  The wings. The dumplings,  the fries were perfect.  We shared different bao and each was tasty.  I really liked the crispy chicken and the waygu beef.  I definitely recommend this place"
EvU-aoJUb3SbCJo4yyHYpQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Wonderful experience, food was excellent, drinks were so tasty and nice and strong. It was really nice that they actually had a few tables for inside dining"
rRMMADy_yWCNnCv8EhccsQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Went here with two friends for a fun dinner out and we dig the atmosphere. It's a small restaurant and we liked the noise level. It wasn't too loud so we felt like we could talk, but we couldn't hear other people's conversations. Just chattering from other tables.

Drinks: one friend got the Rabbit cocktail. It came with a little marzipan carrot that was too cute! You could taste hints of the aloe and it was very creamy! Other friend got a pink cocktail (can't remember which one) but it was DELICIOUS! Lemon-y and minty (my favorite flavor combos)

Food: between the 3 of us we split the vegetable spring rolls, the tofu rice bowl, and the char siu big BAO. Spring rolls were nice and crispy and the sauce was good! The rice bowl was really fresh and I loved the seaweed salad on top! Not my favorite way to have tofu, I think it would have been better with a crispy tofu for texture contrast. The char siu BAO- WOW. So dang good!!! Char siu is barbecued pork and it was so flavorful! Those skinny fries too- HOT DANG. Perfectly seasoned!!"
LAHnEDcI55KUZh2mKvBE5Q,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"My second trip here. Great lunch!

I had the pork belly BAO and spicy beef BAO. I think the spicy beef is my favorite. The fries are seasoned and they give you good sauce for dipping them. I tried the Thai lemon tea and enjoyed it. 

If you haven't yet, you should try this place!"
EPPRj_d1s5dZxdGAPCfoDQ,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,I mistakenly posted a review yesterday and had confused you with a restarting Springfield.  I apologize.  We very much enjoyed your food. We were there attending a performance of a friend of ours and stopped in for dinner before the show. Excellent!!!
hUrGdcheqOpNpAzRbvlmEg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"So surprisingly delicious, this little place has managed to keep my foodie taste buds satisfied during quarantine with their survival bao box - and their family bao kit! This is a MUST try for St. Louis peeps who live for new fun and super delicious food!"
UWXgyAkN3BZTE70CD0cm2w,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,Very quaint spot. Great ambiance and delicious food. A very nice place to get a good drink and great food.
RjVANRaqv92tGiQB8TSe8g,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,Good food. Nice atmosphere. The dipping sauce for the pot stickers and spring rolls was a little spicy as was the fry seasoning but it was still good. I wish they had more sauce to their bao.
tbJtOxODatanExhu3CzlKw,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Yay! Finally, a legit Bao place here in St. Louis!

We always stop by Wow Bao, whenever we go to Chicago. And this place is like Wow Bao's much more refined cousin.

The interior is classy, and food is more upscale. We had the Char Siu, Angus and Wagyu Baos. The Wagyu is tender, and is topped with a delicately fried egg. Our favorite is the Angus Bao, it goes very well with the Kewpie Japanese Mayo.

The chef RJ, is from Hongkong, grew up in Thailand, and worked in LA. Likewise, The Bao is a combination of different cultures. The decor is European, and the menu has Chinese, with hints Korean, Taiwanese, and Japanese.

It's located in Clayton, where Coastal used to be. Same street as Nami Ramen and Barcelona's Tapas. 

Currently open 7am to 3pm Monday thru Saturday. But we were told that they will also be open in the evenings, maybe a couple of months from now."
bmk8S98WvhYsh2JSg5Pl3A,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Dined in last night & everything was utter perfection. The cocktails, bao, udon, service, ambiance were all wonderful. Covid protocol is also great-- Masks required, few tables, which are all spread out-- so glad we made reservations! Amy, our server was so sweet and helpful with recommendations. Is tomorrow too soon to go back? Definitely not!"
zwlrIzjOUga1EfQBHW468g,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,Such a cute place! The food was also very delicious. Our waitress was very sweet. Service was very fast and I appreciated the pay by phone option!
9ZNcMsCI0-O2VtYo0UDdyg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Time for another gushing review! Let me start out by saying that I wish I could have given The BAO at least six stars for their fries alone. So in your mind, imagine this review has way more than five stars. 

I had never heard of the BAO, but the restaurant kept popping up in my instagram feed and in other reviews on here. So I put it on my list of places to try out. And boy am I glad I did!

Located in downtown Clayton, it's in an unsassuming building, that is painted black. While I love their logo, I think you could blink and miss the restaurant while you're driving past. And believe me you don't want to pass it up. Currently, you cannot sit inside the restaurant, but they do have ample space on their patio to enjoy their food while staying socially distanced. Upon arriving you shoot a QR code on the table, place your order for delivery and when it's ready a waiter brings it out to you. At first I thought this was going to feel like going out to eat, but our server came out several times to check on us. Made us feel like we were actually going out for a meal! What a treat! 

If you are unfamiliar, Bao Buns (pronounced ""bow""), but also known as a 'steamed buns' or 'baozi' 包子, are a delicious, warm, fluffy treat of stuffing wrapped inside a sweet, white dough. Made with a mix of flour, yeast, sugar, baking powder, milk and oil, the bao is a tad sweeter than its closely related cousin, the dumpling. 

The bao consistency was incredible! Light and airy while being slightly spongey. I loved the texture of the buns. Plus seriously how cute are they?! I had the hot chicken which could have been spicer, but the actual meat was incredibly juicy. While the lobster sandwich was an upcharge, I'm glad I made my boyfriend pay for it! It was a jumpkick of flavor right to my kisser! So tender and slightly creamy. I never wanted to reach the end of this sandwich. 

That's until I tasted a fry. I could not believe the perfect blend of flavors on these crunchy little delights. And they had a hint of citrus which was such an unexpected pleasure. Without a doubt these fries are the best I've had in St. Louis. I ate my entire order and the majority of my boyfriend's. I just couldn't resist. If you like fries, you'll LOVE the BAO."
XPHO8cWJtftD2JNVA4Qm0g,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"I've been going to the BAO consistently since May 2019. It is always incredible, and whenever it isn't incredible, the staff does everything they can to make it right or make up for the error, and I think that's a really attractive quality in a restaurant.

Their cocktails are to DIE for! They're some of the most fun and creative cocktails in St. Louis, and they're constantly changing and rotating. 

The dumpling style has changed five or six time over the year I've been going there, but they're always *solid.* I always get the dumpling.

The Tom Kha soup is incredible. It's deeply comforting in a way I can't even explain. I loved it so much I figured out how to make it at home. (It was good, but not as good as theirs!)

The crab cake bao and burger bao are my two favorites of the baos, but the others are also good.

Last time I went in, they had changed up the apps pretty substantially, but I'm excited to try more of them because they all looked great"
9J7OeyCHUr_VwUM6hqzhzg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Fresh and Tasty!

Our first visit to ""The BAO"" Clayton! Outdoor seating/ nice afternoon!
We ordered x3 
(x2 Spicy Lobster Bao and Split x1 Mala Hot  Chicken Bao)

The Spicy Lobster (Not really spicy) was excellent! A Generous portion of cool Lobster meat on a warm bao bun with a lightly pickled cucumber topping! (One of the best I've had)

Mala Hot Chicken Bao=Light spice crispy fried chicken again with a lightly pickled cucumber topping. 

Without a doubt one of/if not the best Restaurants specializing in Bao in the STL area!

(NEXT TIME WE HAVE TO TRY THE FRIES!!)"

Never heard of it before I moved out to Brentwood, may be a hole in the wall type place but it deserves better. I don't think there is anything on the menu the average person wouldn't like. Absolutely phenomenal. Please try it. Gyoza pizza is the best. Also amazing soups."

There's bar on right and sofas in front where u can chill and drink. I love handcrafted cocktails  and this place has an extensive list of them. We also shared some baos, apps, and entree.
1)lobster bao: my favorite, The BAO was in shape of hot dog bun 
2)soft shell bao: it sounded good but it was alright in taste 
3)Wagyu burger bao: tasted like a burger 
4)papaya salad: it was fresh and good portion for app but tasted nothing like papaya salad 
5)Thai soup: I didn't taste but others said it was ok 
6)crispy duck: curry sauce on it and it was good 
7)cocktail: I don't remember the liquor but it had lychee in it although I didn't taste it and it was perfect 
8)only complaint is two people got non-alcoholic drinks but they charged $9 each ???
The baos didn't taste like authentic Taiwanese  ones and they toasted them. Everything was very Americanized but they tasted good still."
ma5CW0CyP4WQvttNVrhuOg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,One of my favorite places to eat in downtown clayton. The fried crab bao sandwich is to die for.
8BBUP9FIDU_RxAbbvnh2CA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,I got the soft shell crab bao and the spicy lobster. Both were very good and the soft shell crab was the best. The waitress was very nice and helpful at answering our questions.

I was unfamiliar with Asian fusion and BAO but everything we tested was delicious,  Order a BAO and a bowl so you can taste more of the menu.  If you love spicy get the a chicken Mala.  We loved the Gyudon beef bowl.   The lobster BAO was awesome. Really you can't go wrong!"
a-Ylo4gEVWXSynkOM7JpGg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"From the yelp reviews and it being so close to our hotel, we knew we had to try it and so glad we did. I don't know which Bao we liked the best. Each one was so tasty in it's own unique way. Plus the fries were very nicely seasoned and had a tang of lemon in the seasoning which made it also very unique. We got the Survivor Bao and ordered the fried chicken, bbq pork, teriyaki bacon, and soft shell crab baos. At first I thought I wouldn't be full since I eat a lot but it was pretty filling. We also ordered the fried gyozo and it was also very yummy. The prices are a little expensive but well worth it. It was very COVID safe as pretty much your only option is pickup or takeout via ordering online. There are 3 tables outside so not really an option to dine there. Since my daughter just started freshman year at WashU, I'm sure I'll be back!"
wNzmYueYIlLxbQEI6nBvvg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"Went here specifically because they require proof of vaccinations. Had a great meal. The BAO buns are little pillows of deliciousness. Had the char sui, softshell crab, and fried chicken bao, and barely scratched the surface."

My personal faves were the hot chicken, spicy beef, and truffle waygu. Their fries are also perfectly crisp. MUST TRY SAUCES. Seriously, I'm a sucker for a good dipping sauce & all of them were delicious. The black garlic was one that I definitely need more of next time. 
Their COVID-19 pick up situation is also pretty incredible. I placed my order through YELP & they have you come to side door (wait outside) to give you your food. Food was hot, fresh & packaged nicely. Very reassuring to know they are following guidelines so closely."

Let me tell you, their bao was delicious.  You can't buy the buns.  It has to be freshly made in the premise.  The place was packed with people.  Non chaotic, without any problem.  It is very spacious.
Home warming, and cozy.  It reminded me "" Central Perk"" from the tv show Friends.  If you have a small group of friends needed a place just to chill, this is the place for you my friend.  I kid you not."

Did a curbside pickup for a few baos and a katsu curry bowl today and was wowed by the amazing flavors. The teriyaki bacon is my favorite.

Sweet baby Jesus am I glad I did. We went halfsies on the Char-siu and lobster rolls and the heavens opened up.  Every single bite was packed with a perfectly meshed flavor profile that was unique. Service was great and we sat in an absolutely lovely environment.  Come. Dine. Enjoy!"
6V1H7kgxNKDE7qRsyhyySg,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"This meal was so tasty, as I took my last bite, I asked my husband if we could ask the chef to come out and take a Bao. The joke did not land and dinner ended abruptly.

We were in town for an event and staying at a nearby hotel. We looked up a few spots on Yelp and we decided on the Bao. They are only doing outdoor dining and takeaway. We were the only people eating outside on a beautiful Friday night (support your local businesses!).

We ordered the following:
- Crispy Gyoza - AWESOME.
- Three Bao and Fries Special - REALLY AWESOME.

We got the Burger Bao, Fried Chicken Bao and the Bacon Bao. Surprisingly, the bacon Bao was our absolute favorite. It was so savory and delicious. The fries were also fantastic.

Highly recommend. We will absolutely go back if in the neighborhood. It's like a rainbao on a cloudy day.

Did that joke land?"
t8DwkuaRFsgv-_5j7NlQEA,x8AQIEjSqsW0z4vRyBetbw,5.0,"My husband and I stopped by this evening because I was craving some hot fluffy buns. We walked in and were told we could sit wherever we wanted: inside, the bar or outside. Even though the restaurant has a gorgeous interior, we chose to sit outside since the weather was so lovely. 

Our waitress was incredibly kind and went above and beyond to make our meal great. When I ordered a Thai Iced Tea and was a bit confused when it arrived sans milk, she said Bao serves theirs just as iced tea but she would find some milk and sweeten it. She was so kind! 

For dinner we decided to start with the Lotus Root Dip. It was incredibly refreshing! Sweet chunks of real crab piled neatly atop chopped tomatoes and avocado and surrounded by fried lotus chips. It was as delicious as it was beautiful! 

For the Dinner Bao we went with the highly recommended Softshell Crab and Wagyu Beef. Both were incredibly flavorful! The bao buns were so light, fluffy and warm. The Softshell Crab was crispy, bursting with seafood flavor. And the Wagyu was literally oozing flavors with well-seasoned beef, incredible melted havarti cheese, and a fried egg with a glorious drippy yolk. 

When the check arrived it came attached to a small vinyl record, which I think is a really cool touch. 

To make the evening even more memorable, the Blue's goalie Jordan Binnington happened to be passing by the outside of Bao while strolling down Central Street, and he was kind enough to stop to take a photo with us. 

Thanks so much, Bao, for the incredible meal! We'll definitely be back!"

What I ordered: I started off with the Thai soup and it was amazing! It was a coconut milk-based soup and it had spices with green onion, mushroom, and tofu that balanced it out perfectly. We also got the crab avocado dip with lotus chips. The ingredients were very fresh. Then we got the shrimp starter. (I can't remember the exact name.) It was friend shrimp with crunchy noodles wrapped around the outside served in a spicy buttermilk sauce. It was very good as well! Then we finished it off with the bao dessert. It tasted like a funnel cake with ice cream.l! My favorite thing was the soup, but everything was amazing

These are rather small portions, but the food is worth it! I would love to go back sometime to try a bao!"

The fried chicken bao is a cute portion of chicken sandwich it taste really good , the chicken is crispy and the sauce and veggies is perfect to it. The fries is also good and perfectly seasoned.

UPDATE: I had to take a star off since every single time I go in there there's always a long line and only one person working. I understand this is not the fault of the employee, however I hope the management can start having at least two people working so you don't have to wait 30 mins to get a smoothie!"

They've got a pretty good selection across the board and use actual (frozen) fruit in their smoothies not just purées or flavorings. They also have plenty of add ins including proteins, granola, and almonds which I really like since it gives the smoothie a good crunch. And who doesn't like granola and yogurt, I mean seriously. Seriously! You can easily sub any ingredient for another and now they even have kale and spinach to make you feel better about yourself. Cheers!"

til_b13sDUrKdIseOKRnAw,J_w5J7dgRpyB4GFiBJIDIg,4.0,"There is absolutely no clear smoothie syrup mixed in your smoothies.  Sometimes there is frozen yogurt or fresh yogurt and juice added.  There are tons of choices, and the employees seem to really believe in the idea of health.  Their smoothies are anywhere from $4-$6 and are very smooth.  Some combinations are not as good as others, so it may be a trial and error kind of thing.  I usually come here once a week, and I like hearing what other people order too.

It can take a while to get your smoothie order, and I can imagine that it gets even busier in the spring.  I don't mind waiting though because my smoothies are meal replacements (something that could be 700 calories has got to be a meal replacement, right?) every once in a while when I need a boost.  It is probably unlikely that I could make my own smoothies with agave, frozen soy, acai, and tea for the less than the cost of a Xoom.  They even have a fiber shot haha."

I frequent the Xoom further east on Wilmot, but was pleasantly surprised to find this almost exactly the same with identical menu's. It has a larger sitting area and there is iced water with cucumber available to sip on. I ordered up a ""Max Daddy"" which was chock full of good stuff and included a couple of boosters (things like vitamins, that I got to pick) and for .50 extra I added my favorite Almond Milk. The order was done quickly, it was delicious, and as much as I tried to pace myself drinking it, was gone way too fast. I like Xoom Juice's options a lot!"

From green, to classic fruit, to chocolate espresso smoothies, you'll definitely find a favorite. The struggle here is choosing which one to order because every smoothie sounds perfect. I really appreciate their punch card system too! The only thing that stops me from coming as much as I'd like is the fact that it takes forever to get your smoothie when it's busy. Avoid the busy times of the day if you're going to stop by (unless you don't mind waiting)."
YQlA0PiIre3oYI7jnAJM6A,J_w5J7dgRpyB4GFiBJIDIg,4.0,"I was craving an acai bowl and found this place nearby! Their menu is pretty extensive as far as smoothies go. I had the Dragon Bowl, which had peanut butter, milk, bananas, almonds, granola, coconut, and dragon fruit. It was $6.25 for 18oz and $6.50 for 28oz. I didn't pay attention to the pricing and got the smaller version - looking back I should have just paid the 25 cents more to get the larger version to save some for later! 
I am comparing this bowl to an acai bowl I had in Nashville and this one didn't hit the same mark - but it was pretty good. I would have loved for there to be bananas or some type of fruit on top! 
The worker was super friendly and the bowl was made quickly. 
I'll definitely return to try some of their smoothies!"

How can you beat that?  They seem a little expensive but I could spend the same at a fast food joint and feel lethargic and fat.

Keep your eyes peeled.   I drove past and missed the entrance more than one.  Where does ""keep you eyes peeled"" come from?  What a strange phrase."

This place totally outshines their competitors. Their choices, options, ad-in's, etc. are far beyond what most smoothie joints offer which is a really nice change of pace and their employees seem to enjoy the aspect of health and they really know their stuff, unlike the ""other"" place.

I love how if I let my smoothie melt, it pretty much melts to just pure juice and that is the joy of their smoothies, that they are very natural.  The smoothies are about the size as two small drinks somewhere else.  They are extremely friendly to lactose-intolerant people.  Go get one of their packed ingredient smoothies, and I promise that your tastebuds will be excited!"

I'm in this weird ""not doing soy"" phase after months and MONTHS of drinking soy like it was water. I read all these studies and now I'm concerned, so I've kicked the soy habit and I'm guzzling almond milk. Did you know Xoom will swap out your liquid with almond milk? I had no idea! They'll also swap soy protien xoomers with 100% whey. I'm a changed man. I'm so glad I walked out of there with new knowledge, I just wish I grabbed the cashiers name to give her a shout out!

And when I'm in a rush I call my order in and it's always ready for me when I pick up!

I also like that they use biodegrable cups that are made from sugar cane and bamboo. Just remember not to leave a cup in your car during the summer months because it will melt away!"

I wouldn't describe these yogurt bowls as healthy, but rather, a feel good treat. At $8 you get maybe 10oz of yogurt with mix-ins (such as matcha, mango, banana, apple, cinnamon, etc) and granola. And a ton of honey. Given that you just paid so much for the yogurt, you may as well sit in the store and study all day, which is what it seemed like the women hanging around the store were doing.

Although I found this overpriced, it was very refreshing and I found myself craving a Rush bowl a few days later. So beware, they may be addictive."

Acai Bowl: Beach Bowl
Did you really get an açaí bowl of your don't instagram it? But legitimately delicious with crunchy granola and honey on the top. Doesn't taste like those processed overly sweet smoothies from places like smoothie king, you can taste the freshness. There is a nice amount of granola too, not just a thin layer that leaves you with disappointment. I chose to get strawberries on top for $1 more. I was able to finish the entire bowl and it filled me up decently. I am so happy a place like this came to the CWE, it's really what they were missing. I see lots of people stopping by after workout classes (steel wheels and Orange theory are right next door). 

Overall I am excited to try more from this place, I will definitely treat myself to one of these after a good workout and not feel guilty about it after. 

*edit, unfortunately after trying a real açaí bowl I can say that this isn't truly that authentic. It is supposed to be a lot thicker and larger as well. $12 for one is apparently super overpriced as well, but if you are looking for a smoothie bowl this is the place! I would still come here for a smoothie bowl, but not necessarily call it an açaí bowl."

I was a little biased going in because some of my friends had gone before and they were dissatisfied, but I had a good experience! 

What I ordered: peach cobbler bowl. I loved it! I loved the flavor. I had never seen this flavor at a smoothie bowl place. It came with granola and honey on top. 

Pros: they have so many different flavors of smoothies and smoothie bowls here! I want to go back to try the apple pie flavor. Great portions!

Cons: the ingredients definitely aren't as fresh as some of the other smoothie places in town. You have to pay $1 to add toppings such as fruit, almond slices, and chocolate chips. There is very little seating, just two tables inside and some outdoor seating. This isn't that big of a deal though.

Cons: cost ($7-8 per smoothie/bowl), quantity may be small for some, costs extra per topping

Rush has very generous portions, lots of options (bowls an smoothies), and the price is fair (for reference the axis bowls I get at LAX are $20). They also have a punch card, which helps if you are a frequent flyer! 

My favorite weekend indulgence - check them out!

One downside is parking, being in Central West End, but that rounds out the big city feel for me, bringing me right back to my LA roots. Rush is worth it!

He greeted me while making 3 smoothie bowls at a time and asked if I had any questions. He was definitely working his butt off but maintained a very upbeat attitude. The manager/boss definitely needs to be more thankful for this employee..... the 5 stars is all thanks to this male worker :)"

The guy behind the counter was so helpful in explaining the process and helping me select add-ins and other options. 

I ordered one with a name similar to 'the beach'? Something like that. Added some protein and some coconut flakes on the top. Not only was it packed with the exact nutrients I wanted - it was super delicious and refreshing. It definitely filled me up for the day, as I would expect from breakfast."

CvioB1gkWUEN_cHpLcgZZQ,XriKtVR4J_DG-R0xFqYXEg,5.0,The bowls here are so yummy and they let you customize them. They have a gf granola option which is really nice. The gentleman who served us both times was extremely kind and helpful.
T7uGKeByJQUarGNBFFnf-w,i6Sb4Gm5O-w1rtVZWwzbyA,4.0,"I always LOVE Juice Bar so I am extremely happy this location opened up right next to my house! We were in desperate need of a good juice place in green hills! The space isn't too big but not too small. They have small square (wooden, if you care to know) tables for seating. Plug situation: only found one outlet for the entire place in one corner. Today is their first day to open and right when I walked in, I was greeted with smiles and happy faces (they are so excited!!!! :D). This is my third Juice Bar I've visited and I'm glad to say that there is great consistency with their menu items across all the locations - super important because you know what to expect! 

Plenty of juice and smoothie options and they are happy to answer any questions you have about their juices or cleanse plans. Minus 1 star because this place suffices for just the basics in juice and smoothies. I've visited so many juice shops with unique juices/smoothies that really wow me and Juice Bar in general doesn't give me that wow, and that's probably because of the franchise thing. Nonetheless, their products are ALWAYS fresh and never fail to disappoint in taste. They also have a grab and go case in the event you need something quick. They also have a wall of goodies - apparel, magazines, granola bars, and dry snacks. Maybe in the warmer months they will put out outdoor seating! This place is full of happy people, happy music, and happy healthy food - always a pleasure to visit any Juice Bar."
SSSMpJW5G11F6-EONRw-fw,i6Sb4Gm5O-w1rtVZWwzbyA,4.0,Staff was very friendly and very informative. A friend dragged me here because she is a fan of the Chrisley's. It was well worth it. That smoothie place up the street has nothing on this place.
0tcu1q4CyfkDwR_AQYFcrA,i6Sb4Gm5O-w1rtVZWwzbyA,4.0,"We were walking to the mall from our car when we spotted this place and decided to check it out.  I loved the aged wood they use for their decorating.  We looked at the menu and the man behind the counter asked if we had ever been in before, we mentioned no, and he said they'd give us a sample.

So while we milled over what to choose, out comes 4 large shot glasses full of 4 different juices on their menu.  2 of them were a little to rough for me, I enjoy a little more fruit then veg in my juice.  But my husband enjoyed them.  

We chose the Orange You Glad in a large and shared.  My husband also got a Energizer Essential Oil shot, which actually did the trick!  He said it was rough, but it did wake him up!  

We really enjoyed the service and the juices we were given to try.  I'll have to visit again next time we are in town!"
3p6Q1yi8uA-ukXfD48KEHg,i6Sb4Gm5O-w1rtVZWwzbyA,4.0,"We stopped by here after a little hike at Lake Radnor on Black Friday. My husband and I both wanted something fresh and this was the perfect place to come. My husband got one of the green juices and I got the acai bowl. His green juice was really tasty with a ginger kick yet sweet from the green apple. My acai bowl was absolutely delicious - it had so many different components in it that made for a party in my mouth.

We were thankful to stumble upon this place after a couple of days of indulgent food. I will definitely stop by this location next time we are in Nashville - the service was nice and efficient!"
pJoNq5JUz694VPFJeVQ2xQ,i6Sb4Gm5O-w1rtVZWwzbyA,4.0,Sweet greens is delicious and love the grab and go cooler. They have Hummus Chick hummus which is my fave! Would have stayed and enjoyed my food there but the music is SO loud. I like music and I like loud but not in a small space. Maybe put some chairs outside so people can sit there?
ByeiZsSrs70XH5-O8aFjMQ,i6Sb4Gm5O-w1rtVZWwzbyA,4.0,"Friendly and helpful staff here. I ordered the large orange you glad since I got it and liked it at I love juice in Troy Michigan.
Needed a healthy quencher after walking around the Mall at the greens. 
Glad I referred to my previous review to get me a drink I wouldn't regret at all. 
It's sweet from the orange and carrot and has a refreshing taste from the mint."
F2hIBaD8aPHqeXsarUnsKw,i6Sb4Gm5O-w1rtVZWwzbyA,4.0,"As soon as you walk in, you feel good already because the staff greets you with big smiles! ALL OF THEM!

You can see them prepping the fruits and opening new items so you know it's FRESH.
I had the acai bowl, or rather, cup. I loved it! It was the right amount for me as a snack. I wish it would come in a bowl instead so it's easier to eat. 

I will come back to try the juices and maybe will gather enough courage to take a wheatgrass shot? Maybe."
mkhH9WKRAZOBsaWP2yMidA,i6Sb4Gm5O-w1rtVZWwzbyA,4.0,"I'm not a smoothie person, so this review may be beyond my area of expertise. I'm more of a meat and potatoes kind of guy (thus I'll have a heart attack before I'm 60). In the mean time, if it tastes good I'll eat it.

Nor am I a lover of reality TV. But my wife and I religiously watch Chrisley Knows Best just to see what Todd Chrisley will do next, a wealthy family that recently uprooted from Hotlanta to relocate to Music City. So when the most recent episode aired featuring Juice Bar in Green Hills (started by a couple in Atlanta and locally opened by Chrisleys), I had to check it out for myself.

With absolutely no artificial ingredients and using produce from local farms, the business embraces the same ideals as organic mega-franchise Whole Foods, which I love. It's healthy for your body and the local economy, so why not support them? They feature a wide variety of unique drink combinations; one with cocoa powder and hemp seeds, another with bee pollen and lavender oil, a third concoction of almond butter, coconut milk, and Himalayan pink salt, even a spicy shot with lemon, ginger, beet, jalapeño, cayenne, and peppermint oil! They sell delicacies like living raw truffles, local hummus, and quinoa/kale salad.

The two smoothies I tried were pretty tasty, and I have to keep in mind that healthy food will never light up my taste buds like the perfect Thai recipe, Indian dish, or Greek masterpiece. But it was pretty good considering it was just pure fruit.

There were a few oddities though. They had six employees working during an off-peak hour just standing around waiting for business, which seems excessive. The music is blasting about so loud you'll think you're in a club, so you can barely hear the soft-spoken girl behind the counter. I definitely heard one song in which the singer yelled ""mother f!"" but fortunately the two elementary school kids present with their mom didn't notice. The employees were chopping something for about 10 minutes that was a louder sound than the music, and another employee would slam the chairs around when straightening up. Maybe I'm just too old-fashioned. When I saw the movie Transformers in 2007, my friend and I got a headache from the constant barrage of unending sound effects. Teenagers didn't even notice. That's when I knew I was officially old. So maybe the club atmosphere and loud decibels at Juice Bar are exactly what youth are looking for these days.

Overall, the workers were very courteous, and even came out from behind the counter to take orders when the line grew to three patrons. I was impressed. It's worth a visit, but I can't imagine this becoming one of my hangouts."
TVKkD5JA-TpG4QXoNITQKQ,i6Sb4Gm5O-w1rtVZWwzbyA,4.0,"My first stop at a Juice Bar. I actually didn't get any juices or smoothies as I had already had a smoothie for breakfast. However I did try some of the pre-prepared food that they had including the veggie spring rolls and veggie pad Thai. I was impressed with both and the pad Thai was even spicier than I thought it would be. It seemed pretty filling at the time; however, later I was hungry earlier than normal. After this experience I would check out the juice bar where I live in Chattanooga as well."
H9PhUtTgW02DAW83wW9Fsw,i6Sb4Gm5O-w1rtVZWwzbyA,4.0,"Fan, huge fan. Next to Noodle place off of Hillwood. Parking in front shared with the mall. They have  Juices, smoothies, shots of juices And they let you sample. Also some food.  Very attentive staff, good with answers and attitude.

The music for the.life of me I don't understand the reason for it being so loud. More importantly, why did I stay longer and order yet another 7 dollar juice? Easy answer, really really enjoyed the juice. One can make a smoothie at home, it is the juice that takes the extra effort. A machine that gets the most out of the ingredients, FRESH veges and fruits with zero preservatives and the correct ratio. For that luxury, 7 dollars is a steal. 

Wonderful owners and they have a great story posted on their website. Additionally, one other owner, Crisley from the show. The guy is a riot, but don't expect to see him prepping the veges. I hear his Mum comes in often. I am pretty sure the 1st owner was prepping on my day there. Cannot verify, was too excited about the juice. 

Watched the line go from nothing to 10 a few times in my 25 muntes. Seriously a few times. Moves fast and all seem delighted with their drinks in hand. Clientele were all ages.

We had the ginger sweet greens. Tasted like sweet greens with a kick of ginger. Tried it, liked it, but would like to try the others. Partner had a smoothie, the only orange thing named on the menu located at the bottom. There was no orange in it.  
I went back for the coconut drink in the grab and go. It was not on the menu. If it was colder,  it would have been greater than heaven. It was cool, not cold and it was close to heaven. Absolutely loved it. Just the coconut alone to make it was worth the price...so good. 

Grab and go had sandwiches and hummus and juices and smoothies. If I worked closer, I would have to put this as a budget line for my new fix. Soooo very much better than the chain smoothie places. I don't remember seeing a caloric count, but I could have missed it. Will go tomorrow just to make sure. 

I see another coconut in my future."

We were helped by someone who came around the counter to talk with us since it was our first time in. I decided on the PB and J which is seriously delicious, not too over powering PB tasting like some smoothies.  My friend got the strawberry one and it was amazing a bit lighter than mine I think I'll get it next time! 
I did not try any of the juices because, smoothies are just so much better :)
Only bad part about Juice bar is the music is SO loud!  It was really hard to have a conversation at points."

3nyuq9id9i254WBXR8g-qw,i6Sb4Gm5O-w1rtVZWwzbyA,5.0,This was our first time at the Juice Bar. Honestly the only reason we tried it is because we're huge fans of the Chrisley's. Never even thought about going to one until we saw it on tv. We live in a small town in East Texas and don't have a juice bar here. I really liked it. Would have loved to have met one of the Chrisley's ...but I realize that was a slim possibility. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful.

I dropped my açaí bowl last time I was here and it spilled EVERYWHERE- I felt terrible!! They relaxed it without hesitation and quickly helped me clean up my mess. So kind. I've come in straight from a workout or in the middle of my work day to see a wide array of people-  men in business suits waiting on their smoothies, high school students, and parents with small kids, too- All welcome!

It smells so yummy when you walk in!!

I was impressed with the menu. Most juice places have the same menu... it was cool to see some new combos! 

I ordered bunny love. But added pineapple. It was so yummy! And I think I received a size up from what I ordered so I was happy :) :) :)"

It's the perfect place to grab a snack or meal that actually makes you feel good after worlds. 

I love the smoothies. I get the doc or the green smoothie. I desperately want to try the pb&j or an acai bowl but I keep ordering the doc bc I love it. ‍ 

This establishment is located in the same complex as the green hills mall and there is plenty of parking if it's not mall prime time."

It's tucked away in a shopping area on Dale Mabry, near an Orange Theory and Publix. I was torn between ordering the beach bowl and the beauty bowl, but went with the beach bowl. $10 is about average for a bowl like this so I didn't feel too bad treating myself. I really liked it but I definitely want to try something else next time!"

I will save $10 each time I feel like having a juice from them and just buy a juicer myself. I'm not cheap, just was taken back that 12oz was soooo much and not justified.

Definitely on the pricey side to have everyday, but for a juice cleanse diet or a full meal replacement its an excellent addition to the Carrollwood area! Excited to try a few more flavors!"

ihZ_6DAYaEMdww6uZw2R5A,-ExvxN1QHx4efMLm6PxJ4A,4.0,"The acai bowl is delicious but a bit pricey for what you get. They only carry fruit in season and they need to offer a substitute berry for the season where strawberries aren't available. Or just lower the price.
I love that it is organic and a great place for plant based healthy people like my family. But they need more fruit options! Also, the coffee is not that great. 
The green smoothies are great. I can tell this business is built with a lot of heart and faith. I appreciate the community service aspect of the business. Giving back is very commendable!"

I've been looking for an authentic acai-bowl and was only slightly disappointed because the acai was not very flavorful (it might have just been the nutty bowl I selected). I loved how fresh everything all the ingredients and toppings were, and I think the prices were worth what you get when it comes to the acai bowl! 
Service was weird, as they were selective with how friendly they were to various customers based off of what they were buying and how much money they were spending.
Overall, will not return, but would recommend the nutty bowl as it was delicious and refreshing!"
yU_bzLg6N9GkUAnk2GYCgw,-ExvxN1QHx4efMLm6PxJ4A,4.0,"This is really a 3.5 star rating but I did enjoy my experience and will be revisiting so I find it only fair to give 4 stars. 

As far as location goes, it's 5 stars for me.  I'm so excited to have a juice bar nearby.  I'm mildly obsessed with acai bowls so the fact that I can get one within a few miles of my house is a plus.

The menu offers such things as smoothies, acai bowls, toasts of several varieties and energy bars.  I ordered the nutty bowl which consisted of acai, strawberries, banana, granola and maple syrup.  I wanted to substitute the maple syrup for honey and was actually up charged for it.  Then I noticed honey is sitting out on the coffee counter so that was a bummer.  No biggie, the flavor is what it's all about.  Just the right amount of delicious granola and that banana was spot on! My problem lies with the acai.  While it was tasty, it's definitely not the best I've had in Tampa Bay.  The consistency and flavor remind me of frozen yogurt. This could be a preference thing and while I do believe it is good quality, I've had better. They use cardboard/paper bowls with a cute logo but I think acai bowls are beautiful and should be showcased.  You can appreciate the different layers when in a clear plastic bowl. 

I was also a bit disappointed to see their juices are not made fresh on site instead shipped from another state.  With such vast organic options here in Florida I was hoping for something more local.  They do offer juice cleanses and I may just opt to try one of their 3 days soon.  

Overall I was happy with my bowl and will return, I just do see room for improvement but happy to see growth and wish them much success."
fQOTf067r7yIphtGmhMYpg,-ExvxN1QHx4efMLm6PxJ4A,4.0,"I'm a huge açai bowl fan and wanted to make the hike up to Carrollwood to try this one out. The place is tucked into a shopping center across from Orange Theory. Compact and clean, with modern design, I had no issues with the establishment. 

I ordered the Berry Bowl, which comes with two types of fresh fruit: bananas and strawberries. They were out of strawberries. They had no other fresh fruit other than apples and I believe pineapple, neither of which I find great in an açai bowl. No blueberries, mangoes, raspberries, etc. For a place with multiple açai bowl options, it would be great to have additional fresh berry options if strawberries are unavailable; apples and goji berries don't quite cut it. The bowl, sans strawberries, was good. If I'm in the area, I may give it another shot, but I probably wouldn't make the return drive for this alone. 

I would give my experience 3.5 but graded on a curve. :) Happy to see healthier options up in Carrollwood and definitely want to support that."
5jFN4RB5cEL4diJrn9ioJw,-ExvxN1QHx4efMLm6PxJ4A,4.0,I'm so glad I found this place. Their juices are so yummy. They leave me pumped the whole day!! I recommend this place to anyone. Yummy avocado toast
ZeEErCh8n6hEZYPeNd0x1g,-ExvxN1QHx4efMLm6PxJ4A,4.0,"So I tried this place for the first time a few weeks ago and have been back many times since.  I really like their protein smoothies and the acai bowls. They are tasty and filling.  I also like their juices -with the beet and ginger combo my fave so far.  
Everyone has always been friendly. 

So today I got the avocado toast which between that and the almond butter toast are two of my favorite things on their menu. Since they opened a serving was two slices of sprouted bread with delicious combos of almond butter,honey,and bananas or avocado,Himalayan salt,olive oil,and red pepper flakes.   However now you only get one piece of bread for the exact same price.  Someone said the bread is bigger but it does not equate to what they were making before. That is extremely disappointing and I won't be buying that again from there.  Again juices and smoothies are great but if they are only giving you one slice they should reduce the price.   

Also proving the caloric and nutritional info would be great."
D-SPRLWvVhXrkipK086eOw,-ExvxN1QHx4efMLm6PxJ4A,4.0,"The acai (nutty)bowl I got was fire .  The quality is so fresh and they include the option of adding protein for the people out there that are looking to beef up.
Not only was the food just right and the Barista was upbeat and friendly.  This just blows my last experience of getting an acai bowl out if the water.  I'm looking at you international!
I just wish they had a larger space with more varied seating, but otherwise going to be near the top of my list for an acai bowl."
jvIhTZOzQ5eMfg2u6kI57A,-ExvxN1QHx4efMLm6PxJ4A,4.0,"My first time at clean juice and I really enjoyed the drinks and seeing that it's made fresh to order which is awesome. The menu is very straight forward. The store is small but just right because it's quick grab and go. They have seating inside as well as outside. My fiancé and I both enjoyed our drink and quick snack... I got the detoxifying one and he got the glow one coupled with an avocado toast. I must say although very delicious also quite pricey! For 2 drinks and an avocado toast, it was almost $30 which was very surprising. Then again, it's organic and clean. They also have a menu for those who want to order a week supply of cleaning juice. It's made to order and ready for pick up. As much as I really enjoyed this new adventure, its not something I could enjoy on a regular basis due to cost. Over time... the nice juicer could pay for itself. However, for those who like the convenience of not putting any thought into doing it yourself... and for those who are truly into health benefits of organic juice this is the place to go!"
2lGHugS4Byl3USD1IvIDuA,-ExvxN1QHx4efMLm6PxJ4A,4.0,Every so often I get into my smoothie fits and this place did not disappoint. They are super friendly and helpful. They are great to do a 3 day cleanse....they offer longer day ones as well. There are food option meals as well from avocado toast to bowls.
qWNlWhxhiN6NCiPk2RQ7cA,-ExvxN1QHx4efMLm6PxJ4A,4.0,"BERRY BOWL 5/5: A blend of strawberries, blueberries and acai berries, large amount of hidden treasure found at the bottom of the bowl with a nice combination of freshly cut bananas, goji berries, dried coconut flakes and granola on top. I really liked the consistency; it wasn't overly thick and freshly made, very busy cranking it out for my coworkers and I. I don't know how it's even possible after eating an entire bowl (generous serving), I was somehow still hungry within 3.5 hours?! One of the best things about the Berry Bowl is that you will feel guilt free, think of all of the antioxidants ( I know, buzzword) and you'll instantly feel happy from this natural high!

CASHEW MILK LATTE 4.5/5: I opted for this one after a sample because I can always use a pick me up and enjoy the aftertaste of cold brewed coffee coupled with dash of maple sugar, cinnamon and vanilla. The maple syrup was the right amount, not overly or under sweet. I don't like drinks that are doused with sugar, you might as well open your mouth and dump a packet of sugar in it! You definitely get a nice aftertaste of cashew and coffee. If you close your eyes and put the drink up your nose, it's a harmonious blend of those two ingredients with dominate coffee smell. It's a smooth tasting latte flavor and the best type of drink to slowly sip on while working, help snap out of daydreaming or looking busy *haha* and little bit of caffeine helps me increase productivity level and made sure to savor each sip (expensive price tag). Of course, a stronger coffee blend would have been a better touch, but with this drink, it was correct ratio of all of those ingredients and very happy with trying this drink! Next time around, I want to sample a different drink and try that out! 

There was not too long of a wait and impressive considering the temporary setup Clean Juice created at work and one of the owners was consistently keeping the orders flowing! Thanks for stopping by and for doing this for us!"
W1wbxRO5H8QqjZ7UMMVo7A,-ExvxN1QHx4efMLm6PxJ4A,4.0,"This place is amazing. It's more than an organic juice bar.  This is the first one I've seen in Tampa.  I know some health food grocers  have a juice bar as a part of the store but they just do juices or smoothies.  Or have pre-made  bottled juices. 
Like I said there's more to this place than juice.  They also have avocado toast, oatmeal, açia  bowls, detox cleanses, clothes,  and water bottles.  Basically everything to jump start a new healthy way of life.  Everything is made right in front of you.  
The store is quite popular and across the sidewalk from Orange Theory Fitness and when the class lets out Clean Juice can get pretty busy and cramped pretty quickly.  
I ordered the immunity juice and so did 3 other people and they made them all together so it took a little bit longer to get my order out."

 There do you talk strings come in a pack of 48 or you can buy them individually.

Clean Juice - located right across from my local Orange Theory - is one of my latest morning go-to's. With a menu featuring many fresh, healthy items..I find myself here after enjoying a rigorous workout. I like the menu here and love that the prices are pretty reasonable in the realm of clean eating. 

The facility is clean and the staff is super friendly and patient. Don't forget to download the app for your first visit in order to get your $5 reward! 

So far I've tried:
The Recovery One protein smoothie (w/ whey) - super creamy as it's made with almond butter. Totally delicious and tasty that I finished it so fast. 

The Protein Toast - awesome breakfast. The price wasn't outrageous either and the toast was super yummy  


Overall, I'd love to eventually try everything on the menu, as I'm sure it's all super delicious!. Everything is well-made and honestly keeps you pretty full. Definitely see myself coming back!"

Although it's still amazing, I will make the trip out to the Carrollwood location, Alexander is always welcoming and makes THE BEST bowls in town. If there's ever any question or issue (which there never is) he takes care of it professionally and promptly. Try The Green Bowl, as he says ""made with love""!"

Its cold like ice cream or a smoothie but thinner than ice cream and thicker than a smoothie.  No added sugars too so no guilt.  So healthy, filling, and yummy !  Also, avocado toast here is good too.  If I had to compare it to First Watch ' version, this would come in second.  A simple change for me that would make it better would to leave the avocado slightly chunky and less paste-like.  I did however like the addition of red pepper flakes to it, and the sprouted grain bread it's served on was perfect.
One thing I would like to see is nutritional values for each item."

I have been away from class for a little and I was happy to find it was open when I came back again. There isn't a juice/ acai place up here so I am happy to have one close by! 

I am not much of a juice person so this is for their acai bowl. They have a variety of different flavors, and I zeroed in on the green bowl. Why? Because I love matcha!!! I never had a bowl with matcha in it. It was very tasty and not overly sweet. Sometimes people add sugar to their bowls which is dumb because it defeats the purpose of the healthy food. This is not one of those places. 

Looking around, it is a cute atmosphere with their apparel and community board. Another thing that caught my eye, was the prayer request jar. I loved that, and it made me see that this is a Christianity based business. Another plus. 

The bowls are reasonably priced and the only thing is I would like to see nutrition facts for their bowls :-) As someone who tracks their diet closely, I like to have those numbers lol"

   ---   ---   ---

Selfishly, a large portion of my unbridled joy from the opening of Clean Juice, comes from it's proximity to my house. Before 03/18/17, I had to drive to International Mall for a solid acai bowl. And I crave acai bowls more often than the average Joe, so the miles on the Veteran's were really piling up. That road isn't free, ya know?

Now, not only do I have my acai fix close to home, but Clean Juice is literally one of the closest businesses to my front door. YES.

Of course, all this would be for naught, if the quality of their acai and other offerings wasn't up to snuff. But on the day of the Grand Opening, I got out of bed, got dressed and made the short trek to check them out. I was obviously excited.

Granted, it's only been open for 3.5 hours of this writing, and I only tried three items, but I was impressed. Here's the scoop:

Nutty Acai Bowl - The acai is a good quality - definitely not too runny, and doesn't appear to be some mass-produced, pre-frozen on a Sisco truck stuff. Sadly, I've had a few like that, but this was not one of them. It actually had a slightly pinkish color, rather than the typical deeper purple. The nutty bowl comes with strawberries, banana and granola at the top, with a pretty deep amount of acai below. A very solid offering!

The Almond Toast - As one of four non-liquid options, I was looking for a more hearty compliment to go along with my bowl. I look forward to trying the avocado toast next time, but I enjoyed this. The toast was small, but filling. I could definitely go with the bowl -or- the toast next time, but I was anxious to try a couple different things for my first visit.

The Iced Latte One - As far as I could tell, this was the only coffee-based drink on the menu. I usually caffeinate myself within five minutes of rolling out of bed, so I was excited to see this as an option. It was very tasty, and something I definitely will order again in the future. My only small gripe is that it didn't seem to pack a ton of a punch, but that could be because I had just eaten so much, so that I was primed for a food coma.

As far as the place itself, it's not huge, but there is indoor and outdoor seating available. They also sell trendy shirts with silly puns involving items you'll find on the menu here like, ""Kale No"" and ""Acai you in my dreams, or something like along those lines :)

You can also grab juice from the cooler or granola-like snacks to go, if you just want to get your fix on the run!

I will definitely be back here very regularly. I'm so happy they chose this location, but we were sorely in need of something like this in Carrollwood!"
ftg0rODIQsvcJ2z7JjeAaA,-ExvxN1QHx4efMLm6PxJ4A,5.0,Amazing fresh juices! Highly recommend the ginger shot...helps when you're feeling run down! Literally burns when going down (lol) but in a good way!! Will be back! :)

If you are going to do the cleanse call ahead and they will let you pick up the fresh juice the next day. I do wish they pressed the bottled juice at each location but unfortunately it is shipped in from a different state. The location is easy to get in and out of and they have always been helpful when I have had questions. They also have a rewards program if you buy a lot of fresh juice or their acai bowls.

Being a health nut has it's pros and cons like eating food that taste like cardboard in exchange for washboard abs, but at this place you won't have to make that sacrifice. The food is surprisingly good with juices and smoothies to match! I will be honest though, if you've never had a kale smoothie/juice before and just curious to try something new please start with homemade. But if you just left yoga or the gym and want to fuel your body with happy components like coconut water, nut butter and leafy green that will motivate your consistency, you'll be happy to come here. 

The associate here are alert (probably because of the kale) and ready to assist. They offer suggestions for first timers and advise to signup for the app to receive $5 off of your current purchase. 

Overall the place is nice and clean with a fresh smell of organic produce. Spacious for small groups and patio seating"

Their apparel is funny and nice quality. I love all of their options. Their juices are delicious and so are their açaí bowls. I'm a return customer for sure!
oIBVIPanTaqMgCJpjHIOaw,rCa_2d4960Lg7vP6xMV10A,4.0,"Best bowl experience in Nashville so far! I don't give a 5 stars rating because I wanna try the power oats bowl so bad but I couldn't because the oat cooker for make it was broken. So I asked for an alternative protein bowl and they told me that I could make my own bowl adding any protein resource and any other kind of ingredient in it!

I was doubting between the beauty bowl and the green bowl and finally decided for the first one adding whey protein to it. And was so delicious, so creamy and so fresh! You can taste the cold brewed coffee in it, and mixed with the crunchy granola, the cacao nibs and the almond butter is the perfect punch to start the day full of energy after a tasty bite and feeling healthy as well!

The people working there is so nice and friendly, and they also have free WiFi, which is a must if you are planning working there for a few hours enjoying your smoothie at the same time.

Looking forward to going back and try something else!"

There are so many amazing and healthy options (nothing unhealthy here).  Almost everything is organic with the exception of a few items (maybe 4-5). They have bottled juice in the fridge that you can purchase for later consumption. I was able to sample a variety of juices from the fridge. I'm glad I did because that allowed me to purchase exactly what I wanted and I know I'll be enjoying those juices later. I will definitely return. Thanks for treating us so well :)

They're flexible and can make you almost anything you want! I got ""The Recovery One"" and it was PERFECT! I think plant based protein is nasty so I love that Clean Juice offers Whey... and the smoothie had good fresh flavor without being too sweet, and the 16oz smoothie was roughly $8 with tax which was a much welcome break from the $11 ones I've sipped from other juice/smoothie joints. Job well done Clean Juice! You've earned a new regular customer!"

It has Hemp or Whey Protein, Organic Almond Butter, Organic Almond Milk, Organic Banana, Organic Honey, and Organic Strawberries. Very refreshing, not sweet, and definitely filling. A great way to start my morning. Then I got a strawberry scone that is gluten free and vegan and totally a unicorn. I have no idea how they made it so soft and yummy and still used ingredients that are good for you and the planet. Lastly, I ordered a sweet green cold pressed juice for later. I have not tasted it yet but I'm so impressed with this place they already earned the five stars on my book."

The building is very pretty and simple. They have a huge menu on the wall, you are also able to watch the employees make your smoothie, juice or bowl. They also have a grab-&-go fridge full of fresh pressed juices. 

They have parking in the back, one hour free. Near this location there are other food options, and if you talk a little walk around you can explore the very walk-able neighborhood of East Nashville."

I didn't rate it until I went back because I wanted my rating to be separate from the event. I had great service again and tried a smoothie this time that was fantastic. I've been waiting for a good smoothie place to come up over here in east and I'm so happy with this one. I got the simple one and it was perfect for what I was craving, fruity with a creamy base (coconut milk). I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back, despite the higher price point (good quality ingredients)."

A few caveats before we begin: 1.) Clean Juice was a CMYE partner for Yelp Nashville. 2.) Clean Juice was a partner of Yelp's March In Formation. 3.) This review/experience comes far after both.

Come here! It's pretty interesting to me that no one swooped in to fill the juice/bowl/healthy void left in the Edgefield/East End area once Lynne Lorraine's closed. C'mon. Have you seen this demographic? It's like shooting fish in a barrel. Yet... nothing. I'd forgotten that prior to LL's closing, I was there on an almost-weekly basis. Yes, there are juice/bowl-adjacent businesses nearby and juice/bowl businesses not so close but there wasn't a mix of the two... until now. There wasn't an 'I-can-have-it-all' option until now. Clean Juice is that option.

Yes, it's a chain. I get it. But, it's staffed by some of the most genuinely nice people I have met in Nashville and - certainly - have met out east. The vibe of the store is very positive and it's hard not to smile just because. And in addition to the natural light from the windows and high ceilings and warm white paint and easy parking (first 1.5 hours is free in the back lot), the food is really good... and there's a lot to choose from.

I have had a seasonal acai bowl, a couple of different juices, many of the packaged gluten-free goodies (dangerously perched by the cash register, daring you not to buy five for the road), and a greenoa (more on that in a bit) bowl. They also serve smoothies, toasts, cold-pressed juice, shots, and many more. If you think you've been to a juice store and seen it all, you haven't. I enjoy the fact that the seasonal bowls are so creative and unique. From the chocolate cherry bowl of winter to spring's carrot cake bowl, you're going to enjoy flavor combos you don't regularly get in healthy food stores. The cold-pressed juices have color-descriptive names, rather than anything kitschy. Orange (carrot, orange, pineapple, and tumeric) and Red (apple, beet, carrot, and lemon) are my favorites. To my list of faves, I add the greenoa bowl. The greenoa is a mix of greens, quinoa and more healthy offerings to fill you up and help you live your best life. My Yummus bowl was a mix of 14 types of greens (really?), quinoa, dates, walnuts, avocado, cucumber, and hummus. I topped it with a honey poppyseed dressing. My endorphins were sky high after eating the bowl and I was more than full.

Clean Juice is not cheap (especially after I impulse buy sweets at the end of the transaction) but that's America. Food that's good for you costs more. It sucks. It's unfair. It's the way things are now (vote and demand better). That said, Clean Juice is priced fairly and you get a lot of quality food for your dollar. Whoever researched where to set up shop could not have gotten it more right. Each time I have been inside, there's been a line of people. There's a reason for this. Discover the reason."
koITw7P7LfV2EdXqUh65zw,rCa_2d4960Lg7vP6xMV10A,5.0,"This spot offered the early morning spring in my step that was very needed for the drive ahead. I was their first customer of the day at 7am (I may or may not have hung out in the parking lot for ten minutes before they opened). Worth noting, their parking lot along the side of the building makes this an ideal spot for hopping off the highway for carry out. My ideal combo for food on the road during work travel is an açaí bowl and fresh juice. I have a knack for picking eats that are difficult to consume while on the road. 

The ladies running the shop was extremely friendly and hospitable. I loved how they were very proactive in offering samples of the juice lineup. I ended up snagging one of the cashew milk cold brews paired with the green almond butter açaí bowl topped with added goji berries and fruit. Next time, I'll go for the larger cashew milk (with a hint of salt) as a personal souvenir to pair with coffee for the week when I return home (so good!)."

I had never tried Clean Juice but it's close to my house so I decided to make the drive. WELL WORTH THE OUTING! The staff were super kind, and gave me their suggestions. I ended up getting the Immune Booster Shot which was really tasty (ginger lemon & carrot) and the Berry Bowl (açaí bowl with berries, almond milk, bananas, granola, honey, goji berries- your basic açaí bowl). Hazel was the employee helping me at the counter and ended up giving me what they call a Kindness Card - meaning that as a random act of kindness they completely covered my bill, on the condition that I pay it forward with a random act of kindness sometime. I cried right there at the register, it was such a caring gesture. Moreover, the bowl and shot were delicious, filling, and gave my body exactly what it was craving. Wrap around TLC from this place - physically and mentally - and I will definitely be a return customer. Thank you!"
b2jEtkfMCAwmdc2szroynQ,rCa_2d4960Lg7vP6xMV10A,5.0,"Clean Juice is a great addition to the neighborhood, good for a quick juice, smoothie or healthy light meal.  I parked in the pay lot in back, which will grace you and hour 1/2 before you have to pay.  Just get a ticket from the machine for your vehicle and head in the back door.  The space is light filled, open and clean with a large counter space behind which they make the food and drinks. It smells so fresh when you walk in, you feel healthier just being there! I wanted to try something different than the usual fresh juice or smoothie, so I chose the beauty bowl. It was a chilled mix of cold brewed coffee, banana, cacao, vanilla, activated charcoal, almond milk and maple syrup.  After they mix this all up and put it in a bowl they top with granola, almond butter and cacao nibs.  It was truly a unique taste, the charcoal and coffee giving it an earthiness and making it not too sweet. I'd like to try some of the other bowls next visit since I found this bowl to be a little bland. A feature I really like is they list the calorie count of all items on the order boards, so you know what you're getting. The two women working the counter were friendly and helpful, and told me they can always customize any item just the way you'd like, as well as adding from their long list of add-ins. They strive to have all ingredients be GMO free and most are organic as well. Clean Juice offers a cleanse program of varying lengths to help anyone wanting to give that a try.  Clean Juice is worth checking out!"

We asked the employee, Sunshine, what she recommended, and spent several minutes with us going back & forth deciding, all while suggesting tips and hacks to get exactly what we wanted. She was (pardon the pun) the shining star of our trip to Clean Juice. The smoothies and bowls were amazing, too. Overall a very pleasant experience. 10/10 would recommend."

5an_HoCEpb7g2N1YDCr7Og,rCa_2d4960Lg7vP6xMV10A,5.0,I love this place. They stand behind their organic promise and are very transparent about the ingredients in their products. If they don't have a menu ingredient that is organic that day- they identify it on a board by checkout. The app is great. You can customize nearly anything. They use compostable packaging. And it's affordable. Do yourself a flavor and go. See what I did there .

I loved that the granola wasn't sugared up. Nothing worse than very seeet granola except maybe mint chocolate chip ice cream. 

Portions were good. Fruit tasted ripe and sweet. Refreshing. Tasty. We were happy with our bowls of acai and berries. You can get it customized with or without honey. Add or subtract toppings. Not cheap but very enjoyable .. 8 or 9 bucks for a yummo fruit bowl or a bit less for a smoothie."

The employee that greeted me was very nice she politely asked if I've had an acai bowl before, which I have. The menu is small and includes smoothies and acai bowls. However, you can build your own and they have a good variety of fruits and toppings. All bowls come with granola and honey but they still ask you if you want the honey which is great cause I dislike honey. I got a tropical bowl that included papaya, mango, kiwi, pineapple, coconut flakes, granola and of course acai. They have a bowl that comes with dragon fruit or as they call it there Pataya. All in all I really enjoyed it and it was quite fresh. The fruit quantity was rich but the other toppings (I asked for chia seeds) were less than a sprinkle. All in all I would try them out! I've had better bowls but this was quite good."

Unfortunately, the female employee gave me something entirely different for the takeaway order. She added strawberries and granola (I'm gluten free.)

UxG9zRq9lCBNQ5xy-J-VXQ,DQ8qh7o8clZo5wZ2XgbchA,5.0,"I fell in love with Acai bowls at first bite at Under the Mango Tree in Miami in 2015, which still has the best acai bowls I have ever eaten. The bowls are a cold, sweet treat that is good for you since the acai berries are high in anti-oxidants and the toppings are generally healthy. I have sought out great acai bowls in my travels ever since I tried my first one. Not surprisingly, the best bowls are in the hot or tropical climates I have visited. Accordingly, Tampa has some excellent spots for acai bowls. Rahvia Acai Bowls is one of those spots. I ordered the Berry Bowl. The acai base was great. The temperature is perfect: cold with a chill. It was a tad sour from the berries and I really like it that way. All of the toppings were fresh and excellent: granola, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, and kiwis that were substituted in for raspberries since they ran out of them. I also find that a stellar honey really tops off a great bowl. It is generally an area of improvement I note for a lot of bowls I have eaten. Rahvia passed my test. The honey is very sweet and delicious.

It is located in Clearwater shortly after you return from Clearwater Beach and get off the causeway. It is a perfect snack to wait out any traffic if you run into any. For me, the bowl really rejuvenated me after enduring the heat from walking the beach."

I hope to see them find a better more environmentally friendly option, at least for those intending to dine in or atleast a recycling bin.

Def worth the drive!! The shop itself resembles one of those froyo places, but has a fresh feel with clean whites and bright pops of green and purple. The menu wasn't too extensive, but I appreciated that they had the option to create your own personalized bowl. Having lived in Hawaii and have eaten Acaí bowls at least once a week out there, I was pleasantly surprised at the options they did offer! I opted for the Rahvia Bowl, after asking the cashier for her personal preference and what was most popular. The Rahvia Bowl came with blended Acaí, crunchy granola, topped with fresh strawberries, blueberries, and mango, and then sprinkled with shaved coconut and drizzled with honey. It was absolutely delicious, bursting with fresh flavor, and the perfect size (not too big, not too little). I would definitely recommend this place, and will be visiting again soon!!"

Acai is a fruit loaded with antioxidants.  It is frozen as a slushy base of the bowl on which you add the toppings you like. 

This place has a handful of bowls to choose from, but you can create your own as well.  

I went with the Tropical bowl and it was tasty.  Base of a Acai, topped with granola, diced mango, kiwi and papaya and coconut flakes.  Delicious!  At $8, well worth it if considering the cost of ingredients.

They also have smoothies.  It's a welcome, healthy addition to the area.  Wish it were closer to home."

I love how they blend the acai with the fruit, and also have the fruit as it's toppings. They have an app where you can order ahead and pick up which makes it so much easier to just pick up and go. I really love this place so much."
bJHfhddi88EtzZ2GWtgvlg,DQ8qh7o8clZo5wZ2XgbchA,5.0,THE BOMB DOT COM!!! Peanut butter bowl and add Nutella and chocolate chips or if you decide to get a smoothie get the PB smoothie and add Nutella or chocolate chips OR BOTH... the best things on the menu!!
UJQFHbhmy-0e4hlX40ozmg,DQ8qh7o8clZo5wZ2XgbchA,5.0,We are out of towners and decided to stop here for breakfast. The peanut butter bowl is out of this world. We also got their signature bowl which was delicious as well. Really you can't go wrong with any of them I don't think. Would definitely go back
bgjHh5HGOnZnqSOX2kxImw,DQ8qh7o8clZo5wZ2XgbchA,5.0,"Delicious bowls! Staff is friendly, they greet you when you come in and when you leave. Very clean inside. The bowls are priced at a good price and you can choose from getting a small, medium, or large bowl. So far I have tried the original and I tried some of the dragon bowl and they are tasty! I will be coming back to try more bowls and smoothies! Keep up the great work."
jArA2SAsbhfT91ouOMbktw,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,4.0,Good not great! They need to add hazelnut drizzle as a topping. The coconut shavings were stale and chewy. I had the tropical pitaya bowl. Next time no coconut. I wouldn't travel for this.
DfuCUN3bygRpKBsydSwRrQ,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,4.0,"Can one ever go wrong with an acai bowl?
The peanut butter one was delicious! Normal prices to expect for an acai bowl place.
Lots of flavor and fruit - all complimenting the other items. 
Its a good place to go also, if you have never had one.
Service was a bit slow. Fairly friendly cashier."
kKymkFnvass8HzHKvJ0LBg,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,4.0,Went with a friend to try the new vegan ice cream and it was SO good. I also love all of the topping options (chocolate almond butter drizzle?? yes please!). The cookie dough chunks were also really good. It's a bit pricey so I can't go too often but it really is super tasty :)
NJT5vibER1wxSIjS_eEuAA,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,4.0,"Thank you for being the only juice spot that opens before 9am- greatly appreciated! 
I am SO STUFFED as I'm writing this review 
You're Yam cupcake was soooo delicious, and let's not talk about that Keylime Donut- Deeeelicious!
This was my first visit, and based on what I've tried so for...I'll definitely be back fore more! I'm so impressed with the owner's concept for this business; It's totally geared around health, food,and business. 
The prices are the  same as pretty much anywhere else in Tampa, so I feel I got my money's worth 
I loved the variety of cold pressed juices, nut-butters, take home meals, Kale chips, baked goods, and the list goes on! Let's not forget the bonus room filled with all the athletic gear- loved it!
Over all this juice spot was great, and and enjoyed every bit of SOHO JUICE CO THANKS!!"
zcgcX3NY589Pikv3nRKVog,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,5.0,Friendly staff and tasty protein smoothie. Loved that they had vegan based protein. The menu also had a lot of healthy options.
q2fyB646wOpI_oW_bGlPiA,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,5.0,Ok obsessed. Thank you to the girl at the register who explained all my options throughly! I ended up getting the soho one but now I can't wait to try the rest of the menu yum
vQiV-tU7de97X2i2STNhng,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,5.0,"Doralys has the great service, she had a smile on her face when I walked in and greet in with manners and took care of me! Thank you SOHO Juice Company for hiring great employees to optimize customer service."
AMnlKEU04kVoGZ8hlFbP7Q,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,5.0,"Stopped in while I was in the neighborhood and a really cool location! Got the Cloud 9 bowl and it didn't disappoint, friendly staff. Soho has the best smoothies and service in FL! Also love that they extended their time to 9PM in certain shops!"
wfAdpUsxicatet7D021aLw,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,5.0,Great new south tampa addition! The inside of the store has awesome murals on the wall and there is a little boutique with athletic wear as well. The wait wasn't long but it was nice to shop while they prepare your order. The ladies working on opening day were friendly quick and efficient. I sampled the new charcoal soft swerve (it's called that!) and it was delicious! I ordered the coco verde açaí bowl which was also very good. The smaller size is still quite a generous portion and filled me up. Their are a couple parking spots behind the building but people are usually in and out quickly here. Can't wait to come back and try something new!
3rDfC62NWopTWVWKHAMUeQ,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,5.0,"Two words: SOFT SWERVE. Its a game changer. 

I love this new addition to the SOHO Juice family. The quick serve concept is part of the storefront FLY and it has a great vibe. Jill was the most helpful and amiable worker we were met with at the counter on the Sunday of opening weekend. There was a good amount of parking in the back and you can miss the entrance to the parking lot if you blink (the driveway to the parking lot is right next to Genghiz Khan)! 

My healthy eating PIC and I were there to order their amazing frozen dessert concoction known as soft swerve, their exclusive VEGAN version of soft serve ice cream. There are two flavors available AT THIS LOCATION ONLY. I am conflicted on how I feel about this, as the original South Tampa location is walking distance to my house but I actually have to drive here for this new product but I digress. 

I selected a cup of this magical dessert and added some awesome indulgences. Gluten free cookie dough? UM YES. Cashew butter cups? Yes PLEASE! I practically had to smack myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. My reality had forever been altered by this heavenly treat. 

Jill was most helpful and offered samples of items offered so if you are wondering what something tastes like, you can ask if there are samples so you can try. After we ordered our highly anticipated desserts were up in moments, photo appropriate and ready to be devoured. Please take the fact that I did not snap a pic of my cup of magic that I was too eager to dig in. Or, it could also be the fact that I have a newborn I take care of these days. 

The seating area is nice and comfortable and there is a bar to eat at with a view of outside, bigger than their original location. There are some also very cool wings with positive affirmations on them that create a nice photo op (don't forget to hashtag). 

Overall I was quite impressed with this new location and the fact that it is part ""atheleisure"" clothing store is rad. You can shop while you wait. Normally the wait is not long, however, unless there are a slew of people in front of you. 

I highly recommend you check it out and judge for yourself! Everything at Soho Juice locations are gluten-free so those with celiac or gluten sensitivities need not worry to eat here. This, like all SOHO Juice Co. locations feature fresh pressed juices and cleanse programs, packaged house made granola, almond and cashew butter cups, non-garbanzo bean based hummus, kale chips, etc. Soho Juice is perfect for a healthy snack, a pick-me-up, a healthy vitamin rich meal, or an indulgence. You can choose your health potion. I was impressed by their unique hummus flavors and I saw that many are zucchini based which is awesome. I've been told they taste just like standard hummus so I will have to try for myself. They also serve kale chips and other vessels to eat with it. I's consider it a great one-stop snack destination.  

Pro tip: Join their rewards program in which you are identified with your phone number. It can be used at any location."
iUMDzPRk-8laxpkSadBKgw,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,5.0,My first experience at soho juice was amazing!! I'm a huge açaí bowl fan and the options here are so good! I'll definitely be back to try all the different options!

Soft swerve.The taste was great not to heavy.I will
Say I try to avoid sugars in any form ,so it was a bit 
Sweet for me but ,someone who's not avoiding sugars this is the perfect healthy treat.They also 
Have healthy toppings you can add as well,along with all the açaí and dragon fruit bowls they offer!
I simply love this place! Best place in Tampa by far"
r1qNVXDkaNzsKE3qL4zy2Q,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,5.0,"The place is clean, beautiful, and the ice cream was delicious! I got a swirl softserve in a cup with cookie dough pieces and a chocolate syrup. Sooooooo good. Staff was also super sweet. Excited to go back!"
xhHit8cXOd8gDXpXHK0Y0A,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,5.0,"This was our favorite place! So sad to see that it closed without notice to the customers. We were there a week ago and when we tried to go back this week, we were informed this location was closed. We tried the location on Howard, but our bowls were made incorrectly and we ended up throwing them away. This location was great!"
BTEuRLlMMutrQc_SNSitYA,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,5.0,"Fav spot to bring the kids for a guilt-free treat! Their fresh juice is amazing, lots of flavors and reasonable price. This spot is unique because they also are combined with a small active wear boutique, cute idea! The employees there are so sweet and they probably would of let my kids try all the samples they had (And my kids love it). Their ice cream is gluten-free, vegan, soy-free, & dairy-free. They have lots of toppings to choose from and the portion size is massive! We also had their s'mores donut and it was so gooey and delicious! I like this place because it keeps me on track with my healthy lifestyle but allows me to treats my kids. Flavors are 10/10.
Atmosphere 10/10, lots of natural night, table tops and a bar area by the window. 
Parking is 8/10, parking lot is small but I've never been here when it's been super busy.
100% love this place! We will be back for more treats!"
UDUtPrULRkR3ssRA2t6iHQ,m61MRBD5w9udzeJQIWe7oQ,5.0,"My absolute favorite place to get a Açaí bowl. The base is thicker so it's like an ice cream almost. Huge portion. They put two types of granola in, one on top and one on bottom. Almond and chia. They are always super nice and helpful. Everything is organic and vegan. Compared to other bowls I've had at other places they give you a lot more topping included in the price so it's less of a basic bowl and the taste in better in my opinion. I got here at least once a week. They have many different bowls as well even if Açaí isn't your thing as well as smoothies, juices, gluten free baked goods and much more."
JbSUjGLyKEVDAvRecZePYg,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"Love the increase in options for juice and healthier foods in downtown!

If a juice bar isn't going to offer made to order juices, they've got to do a better job of keeping the premade bottles in stock. It's disappointing to have only a few choices with no option to have one made to order because they ONLY sell what is bottled in the cold case.
The smoothie bowl was delicious and a great idea.
Ambiance is great! They need more employees in the early am juice area. Only one girl who was trying to make large batches of juice (to bottle) and wait on us. Meanwhile, in the back ""restaurant"" area, there were several employees prepping for lunch crowd.
Will definitely return."
mJ7ClHuEcC52RvwQrFBn6g,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,Brass bowl has a great mix of menu items. The build out turned out really nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. I have to try the happy hour specials still.
FTFt01SO_kOsQIf48SEyjg,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"Went here for dinner on a Wednesday. Only one additional group of about 4 people were in. The business setup has the juice bar up front and the bowls in the back. Took a bit to decide on the menu and I got a standard bowl, they were out of one of the vegetables and then said they could replace it with brussel sprouts, they charged me extra for it. As they were preparing mine, they hadnt even taken my friend's order which I found odd; they said they wanted to just make mine first. My friend ordered a steak bowl and was told if he would take chicken since it would be quicker and it was already made; again odd thing to say to a customer. Quality wise, they have great ingredients. Everything in my bowl tasted great (brussel sprouts could have been cooked a bit more though; but maybe just a personal preference). I do think theres a lot of room for improvement but it was a nice experience overall; lots of options to fit anyone's dietary needs."
ClU29slJbm1wJ2BO8gl-Ow,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,This place is cheap and pretty good. The brussel sprout are super good. Salmon was a little under cooked and the greens in the salad was cooked which I did not expect (and did not really like). This place is fast and newer. I also like how it's a healthy place to eat. Need more places like this.
dnxLxIxYWJVSeewDQaiQpw,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"Not bad, but considering that there are an infinite # of phenomenal restaurants on Central, this one just wasn't as up to par. Menu options were pretty eccentric and good, but there were elements of each dish that just made this 4 stars rather than 5: vegetables too salty, potatoes too charred, tuna too grisly, etc. Still a great choice 4 a quick bite but by no means something I would return to. Was more of a one and done"
bXne63H8tzHZINJPrbj_EQ,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"Kinda weird, ""Twix-like"" left-side vs right-side thing going on here. Cold vs Hot side. I was just looking for a quick smoothie to sub out lunch on the go - WRONG!! Emilie told me about juice bowls, even she had a hard time saying ""acai"" and explaining the difference b/t ""eating"" juice vs ""drinking"" juice. All she could do was point me towards the premade juices in the stand-alone fridge. That's when they peaked my curiosity and interest, so I guess, good job Emilie. 

After buying the expensive juice called Wake Up Call, I wandered back to the hidden hot side in the back.
OH MAN! Cool stuff on the menu that I wanted to try and made me have instant buyers remorse over my tasty $9 juice. 
I ordered the Old World Hummus and the Honey Roasted Brussel Sprouts To-Go but was confused when I was asked what 2 sides I wanted with my hummus. I asked the difference between the Honey Roasted Brussel Sprouts for $6 vs the brussels that come as a side. ""Nothing"" was the reply and so I quickly 86'd the $6 order of Honey Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Thank You!! 
I didn't realize until I got back to the office that they pile it all in 1 bowl (except the bread). So I had cold hummus, with hot brussels and cold cucumber salad, sweet and salty all together. Alot of flavors mixing that I thought would never mix. Next time I'll request to compartmentalize them. No worries, I just didn't know. 
The hummus was delicious, the brussels are very good  but the cucumbers are a tad spicy for my taste but luckily enough didn't mess up the other stuff in the bowl. 
I'll come back to check out other hot things."
tWbCx3dLUxN8JNglrTuWSg,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"Delicious, healthy food - great big open space. Loved our dinner here and the attentive managers and service.  Welcome!"
1Q2I37eHb4V6wCGEkyqG6Q,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"First time checking out the brass bowl! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, vegetarian with zucchini and carrot noodles. The Brussel sprouts side dish was also very good. My husband had the central avenue bowl, he wasn't overly crazy about it but he is adapting to the healthier options that are more available here on Central.

Take out service and online ordering were quick and easy. I will look forward to trying this spot again."
-7wOPxLdh9R-sc6H-1Mshg,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"The protein, salmon, tuna, chicken, are great.  The other stuff, eh.  The sushi bowl was boring, definitely needed more stuff.  Too much cucumber just makes you fart.  The Pure Brass had good stuff, but after a few bites, I felt like I was eating a lot of oil.  The salmon was great.  Shisito peppers were ok, not much depth, but my expectations were way too high.
Service was excellent.  The girl that took our order was friendly and I think she was smiling under her mask.
I'll go back, but definitely going to order different stuff."
4izckbnoigsLCyBG-AUQiA,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"The staff wears mask and the place is opened and clean.  The menu is very flexible which you can altered the way you like it.  Food quality is fresh and taste great.  If I need to pick on something, just hope they wipe their hands/groves before packing.  The to-go box is a bit greasy and like being reused. I am sure it is not."
MbMwf2NIipSsuxNx9YH9Og,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"I chose to eat here for my birthday lunch. A big group from the office came with me to celebrate. Brass Bowl accommodated our group and got our meals out in good time.  Brass Bowl features lots of bowls of healthy and sustainable ingredients. It's very vegan and vegetarian-friendly, and my coworkers on those diets were pleased with the selection. 

Just the same as many fast casual restaurants, you can order a pre-set bowl option from the menu, or build your own custom bowl. 

I went with the Hunter Gatherer bowl, which features 24-hour sous vide hanger steak. The base is black rice, with fire roasted sweet peppers, smoked foraged mushrooms, and a 4 herb pesto. The portion is generous and extremely flavorful. 

I also ordered one of their pressed juices. It's fresh and tasty, but at $10, they're extremely over-priced. 

The restaurant has a minimalist design but very aesthetic for perfect foodie pics. I highly recommend Brass Bowl for some very thoughtful food."

I got my sauce on the side and was much more pleased once I added it was extremely bland without it. I mostly enjoyed the scenery & the yelp welcoming and tree =) The juice was good as well, couldn't taste the tumeric or carrots at all. Just tasted like an orange juice. I would definitely like to try out something different next time."
wABAZk4fC93ktsWQ7WleaQ,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"Who can resist a $5 burger with chips?

So Wednesdays are $5 burger/veggie burger day. Combine that with $3 apps and BOGO beer/wine and you've got a very good and reasonable meal. Just hanging on Central and people watching and eating and supporting our locals. So our $20 dinner for two was the bomb!!"
3Y07Lx39ham16pYXeJADVg,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"What a fantastic place to get a bowl especially if you're looking for an alternative to places like chipotle or fresh kitchen. I wasn't able to go in because of #quarantine so I ordered delivery. They have SO many options for your bowl and offer a ton of unique sauces you will not be disappointed! I built my own bowl. My base was super greens and I added heirloom tomato salad, smashed avocado, roasted vegetables, and got their salmon as my protein. I selected the soy ginger glaze as my sauce which really elevated the whole bowl. Y'all. The bowl was MASSIVE. It came with so much food, I had leftovers for the next day. Everything was well cooked, except the asparagus which seemed to only have the stalks and not the top of it, which is the best part. I would love a bit more transparency in what the super greens and seasonal roasted vegetables came with (the veggies came with potatoes which was a bit off in my bowl) and while I didn't love all the veggies I  appreciated the variety in my bowl. The salmon was cooked perfect with a hint of smokiness and the avocado was ripe! We also ordered the blistered shishito peppers and they were AMAZING. I would definitely order again!"
S3FTmbegd2eJD1dfyEzRXQ,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,4.0,"My husband and I stopped into brassbowl this weekend. We received our appetizers very quickly and it was delicious!! The head chef was kind enough to come out and bring us complementary soup as well. So far everything was perfect but for some reason it took 45 minutes to receive our bowls, and there were only 2 other customers in the restaurant... not entirely sure what the hold up was. And we can't say our bowls were very good either. However the appetizers and soup were very good! Will come back eventually to give it another try and try other bowls."

Walking into the restaurant, you find a clean, open and bright space. Tables and stools offer you options to sit. Then you find a fresh juicery and smoothie bar! I wish I had tried it but alas, was just there for lunch. 
We moved to the back to be greeted by the fresh bowl counter! They have a wonderful assortment of bowls and flatbreads that you can choose from or you can be saucy and create your own bowl! 
Y'all know, I went for my own! They had so many fresh options, that it was hard to choose! You get a base, protein, 2 fresh veggies and a sauce. I went with the sous vide steak, carrots and zucchini noodles, mushrooms and cabbage. Before my eyes, they warmed, cooked and assembled everything in a pretty brass bowl. We also, got a side of honey brussel sprouts. The kitchen was clean and everyone moved with efficiency. 
You have fresh, healthy options for drinks that include water, teas, pressed juices and some carbonated healthy options. 
Sitting in the comfy bench, I eagerly dove in! The steak was amazing, falling apart tender with amazing flavor. The mushrooms were full of flavor and earthy. The only thing I didn't particularly like, there was to much liquid at the bottom of the bowl from the zoodles. The flavor was so good and everything was completely fresh and tasty. 
The service was good. I managed to grab a few words with the Chef, very charming, everyone else was very heads down. Very polite. 
I am eager to try it again, already."

Wish we had a place like this closer to home. You can guarantee that we will eat there next time in St Pete! I had the Seoul Bowl and the steak was perfection!!! You can also create your own bowl, which is what most of my family did. Everyone was raving about the food!"

But I recommend getting your own so you have yummy leftovers. The ambiance of the place is great and they are very environmentally friendly. They use real bowls and silverware, and no plastic straws. The staff was friendly and offered great recommendations. Not like a chipotle where they are simply serving your food with no human connection. Definitely go to this place. St Pete needs healthy establishments like this to stay up and running!"

The manager was very friendly and came to check on our meal and bring us to go boxes. All the workers greeted us with a smile and a hello. They have a huge restaurant and if you want juice you go to the counter in the front. The food is all the way in the back just FYI. 
I got the chakra bowl and they had tuxedo beans instead of chicken for vegetarians. The bowl was good! Very filling I have a lot of leftovers. It was a little pricey for the veggies but I enjoyed it! 
My husband got the unrolled sushi and he really liked the rice. The fish could have been colder in his opinion. Overall we were very pleased with our experience here!!"

Different options for everyone's palate. We got the Chakra (curry flavored Asian bowl) and the citadel (Greek inspired with hummus, tzatziki and chicken) and both were phenomenal. Definitely check this place out when you're downtown or just strolling along 600 block."

You can truly taste the difference. The menu is varied with several different types of meats and seafood, all prepared beautifully. The fresh vegetables and hummus are some of the best I've had. Many vegetarian options and they feature a daily vegan protein. I rarely write reviews but I can't recommend this place more highly."
ONszVGx3zEwj9lzrqbbufg,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"Outstanding food and service. The kitchen staff generously remade my bowl after I ordered it incorrectly. The Hunter Gatherer bowl minus roasted peppers, add roasted potatoes was deeply satisfying. The Seoul Bowl was spicy and delicious. Tractor fountain drink (Stone Fruit tea) was just the right amount of sweet and very refreshing on this scorching day."

cjdSRcOxE9tCM_XabBYOTQ,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"I really enjoyed the unrolled sushi bowl with the vegan watermelon ""tuna"" - this was their vegan ""protein"" option. Although it still tasted very watermelon-y, the entire contents of the bowl went together nicely - marinated cucumbers, white rice, avocado, lime, cilantro, crunchy rice sticks. I don't remember what the sauces were that were on the side, but they were flavorful and delicious. 

Their vegan protein changes (daily? weekly? idk). I would love to see them get a permanent vegan protein option on their menu, ya know, like an ~actual~ protein source (vegans, u get me) like marinated tofu or tempeh. 

I will definitely go back again! Looking forward to trying a smoothie bowl as well."
_yWZFixBP8alOsmRS13y1g,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,So glad we randomly picked this restaurant to try from Yelp. The Brussels were AMAZING and the hummus platter and street corn were fantastic too! They have fancy soda and other non carbonated drinks along with pressed juice! Definitely a favorite new spot for my 11 year old and I!
shQP01_0US1W4MlF6CzkKg,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"What a nice find! A healthy meal at a decent price. The ""Pure Brass"" bowl was filled with wonderful variety of sautéed vegetables. Having raw is an option. The salmon was perfect on top! Staff is friendly and accommodating. Our group of 12 or so enjoyed our time in a relaxed, casual atmosphere. I plan on returning!!"
ftkUl94NGsYuuggUW92HNA,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"I was so excited to try this new place and it didn't disappoint.  So much flavor in my vitality bowl.  The house smoked salmon was a big, meaty portion.  My friend got a bowl that was called something like unsushi bowl with tuna and raved about it.  I will be back.  It's counter service for ordering and then they deliver to your table.  They deliver thru bite squad.  They have breakfast and juices, but don't open til 9am and I'm already at work by then, darn it ... will have to go in a Sat.  They're open later (11pm) on the wknd which is nice.  Enjoy!!"

My family and I went to downtown and supposedly we were there to eat biscuits but I rejected the place, and found this place for being so healthy it was delicious! And I definitely would come back, such a shame I live so far from St Pete or I would be back many times. :)"
acoXixWne0Xs8zd6bZ0-EQ,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"Yummy, quick, healthy, gluten-free food. A heavenly haven. I came here from Gainesville to visit local friends and fell in love with this place immediately. If I lived here, I'd definitely be a regular.

Highly recommend."

uM0a6ZN6rBnoWbAuyKlaDg,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed our bowls.  I had the Citadel which had chicken, hummus, fresh tomatoes, herbs, cucumbers and naan bread.   The bowl was full of flavor.  I was initially concerned that I would still be hungry after eating the bowl and a shared side of Brussel sprouts, but I was full and satisfied.  As for the space, who likes to go into a place to eat and have the next table in your lap?  Nobody."
rD_kJU45CL1pHgYiGdusyw,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"Great food, great staff and a great space. Check out the menu - it's all organic and responsibly sourced. I recommend everything, especially since everything is gluten free... including their Naan Bread."

2LP76D7Dso4J1E2OuwcPQw,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"My boyfriend and I went and we both got the Chakra Bowl. His has a bit too much sweet potato for his liking, but mine had a great mix of naan, chicken, mixed grilled veggies and a slightly spicy red curry sauce. It was a bit confusing walking into the empty front space, but we found the back just fine and ordered our food. It was really quick. Will definitely be back!"
RQ7wZpkG9Ps6yxA69qnSRQ,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"The food here was flavorful and substantial. The price was very reasonable considering the quality and amount of food you get. I had the chakra bowl which was yummy. The roasted vegetables were fingerling potatoes, brussels, and yellow and purple baby carrots. The curry came on the side. The gluten free naan bread was very nice. I also had the pina colada bowl - better than ice cream and super filling. Get one to share. SO good! This place hasn't been open long so they are still working out the kinks in the ordering system, but everyone was friendly and helpful. I also loved the atmosphere - nice finishes in the decor and the seating was spread out so you weren't on top of each other. I highly recommend this place and I'll be going back!"
8wjrSDKUHOpiZDi-onQ2xw,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"This place has really good food. It's medium priced, but I feel the price is worth it for the good ingredients. I had the uncooked sushi bowl which is basically deconstructed sushi. The taste and aesthetics were amazing! I tried a bit of my dad's greek bowl and it was delicious as well. I imagine this would be good for vegan and vegetarian options as well."
6y01FIGOh2N9AH-yKGWHwA,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"This is my second time eating here but got it as a take out. Love the eco friendly to-go containers! The food was fresh and very delicious, nothing was over cooked or too seasoned. As a student at USFSP and living on a college budget, this is well worth the money. The build-your-own bowl is around $13 but I can get two meals out of it which is great! The quality of the veggies, meats, sauce, and bases are excellent! Definitely my new favorite fast casual place in St.Pete :)"
m5VV7UK-YurtgL3EKiU25w,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"A new spot in DTSP. The Seoul bowl I ordered was great and picture worthy. The steak was cooked medium rare which I really liked. I think it's sous-vided which explains why it was juicy but not bloody. The bowl also came with rice, Kimchi, micro greens, crispy noodles, and a side of sauce. It's fast casual dining done right. The interior is very clean and contemporary. I'll definitely be back to try the other bowls."
BQKhYF9nZ1jJKX5bX91wYw,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"Healthy clean food that doesn't taste like it's healthy.  This is foodie's food - gourmet, perfectly matched flavors, interesting uncommon ingredients, but all in a counter casual setting.  This is my quickie meal alternative to burrito counters or pizza.  I've been 4 times now. The entire menu is guilt free:  healthy ingredients, chock full of organic vegetables, gluten free. 
They serve bowls and flatbreads. I usually choose one of their bowls, but you can make your own. The salmon is cooked PERFECTLY every time, the sous vide hangar steak is crazy tender and flavorful.  I just tried the zucchini/carrot noodles in their version of Pad Thai, which are cut wide and thin for their pad thai, it was so delicious! There is also ahi tuna that I have yet to try, and many vegan and vegetarian options.
The flatbread is the most delicious gluten free bread I've had, I would not have known it was GF. 
The portions are a little too big.  I leave too full. The prices are $12-14 which I think is reasonable considering this is not fast food, these ingredients are amazing. 
They just added beer and wine, and a happy hour appetizer menu that I haven't tried. plus some natural sodas and teas. They have one side of the counter just for fresh pressed juices and fruit bowls, I haven't tried that side."
0TUu7uibrxjT2o_X7w-AtA,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,Great bowls.  The house smoked salmon is delicious!!  Very satisfying and healthy meals.  Will be coming back!  The chakra bowl and pure brass bowls were very tasty.  Tractor root beer was very good too!
zyldwtrhn4Tld48u89y08A,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,I wish I discovered this place sooner! They had so many options on their menu and they're vegan friendly! The food was fresh and so delicious! The service was fast and the employees were very nice. I cannot wait to come back and try more items on their menu. This place didn't let me down.
FIeEhI1_5TRW9rkbK19jzw,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,This is my new favorite restaurant!  Great bowls and healthy food!  The smoothies and bowls are delicious!
I4mypF3bArQ1e_EbBh2USA,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,New menu and new prices alert!  They added some new food items and kept the staples.  I really love the salmon and tuna with the seasonal veggies and power greens.  This place never disappoints in regards to quality and taste.  Look forward to trying some of the new items on next visit.
DHKyzNb0ItlLyP8K9-ZA-w,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,The food is fresh and tasty. It was my first time there with a group of friends and  the staff was able to help us order. My friend was looking for a spicy sauce and thE chef created one for her one he spot. The restaurant was very clean and had comfortable seating. I will def be back!

tSTrF1-NxkLar3WdCVbraw,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"We stopped here for a late lunch/early dinner around 4pm and there was no line! They are super dog friendly so I was able to bring my dog inside! The cashier was so patient with us while we decided what we wanted since it was our first time there. He gave us suggestions as well. 

I ordered a build your own custom bowl- noodles, chicken, mushrooms, veggies and Korean bbq. My boyfriend got the chicken pad Thai with a side of Brussels spouts. The noodles I got were so flavorful that I didn't really need much! I'm glad the sauce came on the side. 

The Brussels spouts glazed with honey were so good! Definitely on the sweet side but it worked! The prices are reasonable as well. I enjoyed this place very much!"
rw5-somxYclm5ZTaWBEyNw,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"Amazing. Went here with a picky group of 12 and everyone left happy. 

That's saying a lot. 

My father-in-law and I could not be more different when it comes to food. He's very much meat and potatoes. No frills or extras. I'm a vegetarian who loves farm-to-table cuisine. 

Their bowls are not just customizable: the food was fresh and the staff clearly takes pride in the quality of the  product. 

My tofu was perfectly seasoned and the chimichurri had a great balance of herbs and acid. The tomato salad was another standout - again, fresh and done right. 

My father in law got exactly what he wanted: rice, beef and corn. Others got more of a poke bowl, southwestern style bowl, etc. Orders were crafted quickly and correctly. 

Overall, we all left incredibly happy. Highly recommended."
EqnRhgBhuAlOG0Syz_sR0A,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"Stopped by during this covid19 craziness to support a local st Pete business and we were pleasantly surprised by Brass Bowl. It has the same concept as fresh kitchen but the portion sizes are much better. I got a bowl with a vegetable base and it had all of my favorite veggies - kale, beets, sweet potato, string beans, asparagus, and that didn't even include the two additional vegetables the bowl came with. It was all so delicious! My fiancé got a burger and said it was great too. Highly recommend and will definitely be back to try other things!"
s8Bpf0M9fI8UOghIwhBaHw,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"The atmosphere, ambiance, location and service are all wonderful,, but it is the quality of organic food that is most amazing.  With a wide array of options  from Smokey Salmon tacos, to sous-vide steak, to  a selection of vegan entrees you will find something to delight any palate. There is an option to create your own bowl as well. And the entrees begin at $11.95 x ORGANIC!!!!

Enjoy"
L5z6uCuol2q3-ZQ1Jgfb6Q,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"After a very intense 90 minutiae hot Hatha yoga class, the last thing I felt like doing was going home to cook. I was headed to an old faithful but was too tired to drive the few extra blocks, so I just pulled into a parking spot and was hoping to find something healthy and tasty. I looked up and right in front of me was the Brass Bowl.  I had walked past it the other day and was curious so I went it. The place has a clean simple feel to it and it's fairly large. When you walk in the first area to the right is a juice bar along with beer and wine. To order food you go to the counter at the far end. 

I was looking specifically for a protein and vegetables so I opted for the vitality bowl for a 1st try item.  It was delicious. The salmon was a good size serving, the kale was sautéed just enough, the brussels were done but not over done, the avocado was enough and tasty. The was a slight light sauce but also a side of asian dressing as well. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and everyone that worked there seemed really nice and appeared to like their jobs; not always the case these days. 

I will go back and try some more items; I am interested in trying the naan. I saw reviews that said it was really good. They also have a happy hour menu that had interesting choices."
x5cexRHVeTqgDifQYhFE-w,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"We booked our baby shower here after scouring St. Pete for a venue of beautiful atmosphere, catering options and a price that made us feel at ease. In our search, we found other restaurants and catering venues to request $500+ without the inclusion of food cost.
The decorum of The Brass Bowl had the chic wood paneling and lovely bright lighting to present a cozy, open area for our 40 guests to sit comfortably and had plenty of traffic space for our shower games to be played without elbows bumping.
Executive chef Jason Gordon and his crew were professional, timely, and open to any culinary requests as was applicable from the menu. When food was brought to the tables, it was done so on fine wares and meticulous presentation.
Jason was not only our top advocate for taking off as much stress as possible on the catering portion, but he was quick to assist in decorating and allowing for the arrangements of our guests as requested. He gave an above and beyond production for our event, and in the multiple instances where times did not run accordingly with our plans as far as games and guests went, he was quick with understanding and a generous attitude, allowing for postponement of food without compromising temperature or quality. He was easy going with allowing our own food and drink to be brought, and helped present it better than we had ourselves.
His menu allows for some adventurous eating as well as fine dining takes on simpler entrees.
Located in the ever popular downtown St. Pete, The Brass Bowl is a short walk from The Sundial parking garage to allow for all the extra parking necessary to prevent tow truck drivers making a living off of your guests' vehicles.
Simply, the experience was wonderful and our friends at The Brass Bowl took a large portion of stress off of our shoulders by bringing easy food choices, a grand venue and a price to throw a large event for a plethora of people that made every ounce of effort put in to planning it all, well worth it."
hbRYlctiDzhj9CrzF5hebg,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"The juice is so delicious! I ordered the ""Wake Up Call"" which has watermelon, cucumber, grapefruit, oranges and vitamin B. You can taste all the ingredients in the juice, but that grapefruit has a powerful after taste. Grapefruit is one of my favorites, it wasn't a problem for me. 

There's a cute sitting area outside with soft music playing to relax and people watch. 
Now the inside is huge. It's perfect for parties or office outings."
k_th_OpIENUNGhYHjXNcSg,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"Fresh, organic bowls. I tried the smoked salmon with seasonal vegetables and was very happy with it. I enjoy that everything is organic, including the drinks. While I think the quality is worth the price, it is a $20 lunch that is counter-service. The positive is the staff brought food to my table and cleared the tray. Hopefully as they get busier, this level of service continues."
FRIJtUmkLVAaUm5wUdAOZQ,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"Great spot. We were walking by after getting some much needed exercise with all of this covid-19 nonsense and we saw they are open for take out. 

The menu is a great lunch menu. The portions are big, the food tastes great and the pricing is fair. 

What I love is that they have a burger AND also have bowls on the menu. You don't see that ever. 

This was perfect because I was craving a burg and my wife loves bowls. I would definitely check this place out if you haven't been before.  We'll be back!"

Such amazing food and friendly service. The cauliflower flatbread was the best I've ever had and we couldn't stop there we needed to have their bowls! They were so flavorful and fresh. This place was so enjoyable it is worth the drive over from Wesley Chapel. Would love to have them open one up over here!!! Look forward to our next visit."
LTpbAULa5NANe5X-KHXMLw,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"This place is pricey, but definitely worth it for the quality! 

I came here after visiting the Chihuly. I have walked past it a dozen times but decided to give it a shot. Let me tell you, this place is a gem. The food is fantastic, there is literally something for everyone (they cater to pretty much every sort of dietary restriction). The restaurant is very clean and tidy. There are two counters - one for drinks and juices, the other for the brass bowl meals. Once you order at the counter, your meal takes about 5-7 minutes to prepare. I had salmon on top of a bed of mixed greens. The salmon was flaky and tender with a wonderful sauce to spice it up a bit. The greens were fresh and dressed lightly. Overall a wonderful experience.

Price: 4/5

The chef delivers on his promise of fresh and flavorful. If you think you don't like vegetables you gotta try them out here because they'll change your mind I am certain of it."
U52WLd3NK6JkmbuC3OKtgw,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,First time and FAR from the last time we will be visiting! The customer service and attention to personal service by Stephen and his team is unmatched at this little downtown jewel of a restaurant. No matter what your appetite is they have an answer for it with a menu chalked full of fresh and healthy ingredients. Terrific ambiance outdoor with seating where you can listen to live music all over the neighborhood and people watch!
TDnf5K5filLR8xwz1SCseQ,f7Uq0U8iZV0nn9qFVBFWcQ,5.0,"So freaking delicious! I stopped in before a meeting for a quick dinner and so glad I did! This is good eating without the guilt!

Service was great - I didn't catch her name but she helped me find my way to the right counter to order as well as showed me their juice and kombucha selections. I ordered the Chakra bowl. HUGE bowl. I couldn't finish it. But it was beautiful and flavorful - had a nice kick to it. Chicken was not dry - thank you! Loved the variety of vegetables in my bowl. The hummus was good too. The naan was very hard though, not sure if it was meant to be that hard but I couldn't eat it.

Also bought a juice - Citrus Mojito. Refreshing and tart. Enjoyed sipping on it at my meeting.

Big restaurant, lots of seating. Cool industrial vibe. 5/5 will come back!"
M-5EiN32ianeEbgJqATeNw,Q3omBAwUi1TGicLNaRlB0Q,4.0,"Stopped here today for the first time and we were very impressed. It's a similar setup to chipotle, but Korean...you pick from a large variety of items to build a bowl. Prices were great, serving sizes are massive, and the fountain drink selection is A+ (the passionfruit lemonade and black currant tea are delicious). We will definitely be back!"
RHM5Iz3SmbeZ56VJxn-hSA,Q3omBAwUi1TGicLNaRlB0Q,4.0,"Had BIBIBOP for the first time a few days ago and I was impressed. I didn't really know what to expect going input I was pleasantly surprised. The food was good, with plenty of options. It's a similar concept to a Chipotle or Quadoba but with much more options for fresh vegetables.

You really can't go wrong with the place because of the ""build your own"" concept. The protein options were varied and good. I got the steak and chicken, but even tried some of my friends' tofu, and that even was pretty good. But as a mentioned a little earlier I think what makes this place stand out was the vegetable options. It can be so hard to eat a healthy and balanced diet on the go, but at BIBIBOP that isn't really an issue.

I'd recommend BIBIBOP to anyone, it's at least worth a chance. i think is a perfect lunch spot for people on the go."
diaNdFiKHNsogG-OqUeFtw,Q3omBAwUi1TGicLNaRlB0Q,4.0,"Have been waiting to try this place for quite a while, and a flyer for bogo did it finally. Really enjoyed the food and the concept of healthy food in a chipotle style. 

Food was fresh and excellent. Portions were greatly generous for a reasonable price. One bowl was more than enough for a good eater like me.  

Ambience was quiet and neat, and with few cabin like setups caught my attention. Staffs were really courteous  and never bothered to answer all the questions I had regarding some of the items. 

This place is located in a strip mall near fashion mall keystone area, hence parking was super easy with plenty of spots to choose from. 

This place is absolutely worth every penny you spend."
x0Cxys9svQ1lKcMsKSEUZw,Q3omBAwUi1TGicLNaRlB0Q,4.0,"I was actually pleasantly surprised. At first when I went in to the ""build your bowl"" line (kind of like a Chipotle), I was concerned that the food would be too Americanized. But, for our tastes, if I was thoughtful about what was selected, the finished product did remind us of something you could get in a Korean restaurant. I liked that there were various options for bases (so if you're looking to cut carbs, you could choose a veggie base). My one hesitation for going full 5 stars is that you don't get a lot of protein for the price you pay. That said, we would probably come back."
HBNU4GckvhOgUJSPK_T0uQ,Q3omBAwUi1TGicLNaRlB0Q,5.0,"Bibibop is my Go to for lunch nearly every day I am a regular to all 3 stores on the north side Keystone being my Favorite because the staff is so Kind always attentive. The food is amazing and good for nearly any diet, vegan, Vegetarian, Gluten Free, and many others as well. They are also Peanut Free,Msg Free, and have allergens posted on signs by each item.

You must give it a try!"

Honestly keep these spots popping up. I would eat here several times a week. 

The noodles with all the toppings is perfection. Try the kimchi it is delicious."
jgxzIKC_uWkmG5jgtFyazQ,Q3omBAwUi1TGicLNaRlB0Q,5.0,"A friend of mine invited me to go here.  It is most excellent!  I've been here twice - once dine in and once carryout.  Since I was able to decide what to put on the meal, I could decide if I wanted dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, or  meat.  It is all gluten-free.  It is not only easy, but it is fun as well.  The taste is amazing and the portions are generous.  They were out of the miso soup when I went... so, I am going to have to go back so I can get into that.

It is a great concept that works.  I will be back (my wife says it will be when I go with her!)"
4i4ZIUCjD-JzsTE9tusUEg,Q3omBAwUi1TGicLNaRlB0Q,5.0,"Bibibop, you've got me. While I'm on this dairy-free journey for bebe, it's been interesting to find which establishments already are naturally offering dairy free eats and feature strong menu labeling. Bibibop has got it going on when it comes to diet restrictions and allergens. A fair amount of their ingredients and dishes are already naturally vegan. I have to say, I'm a serious sucker for the complimentary vegan miso soup - such a nice touch!

My last few visits have included a combination of japchae noodles (also known as glass or sweet potato noodles), vary veggies, kimchi and sesame seed oil along with the sesame ginger sauce. To top it all off, the mango coconut pudding is also dairy free (and so darned good!). The staff here was on their a-game. If you're looking for an easy, affordable and healthy dinner option, this is the spot for you! Now, if only we could get a downtown Indy location... ;)"
Y55wPIWsGNu-pM1nSLxqpA,Q3omBAwUi1TGicLNaRlB0Q,5.0,"Love this place! There is something here for the vegan, vegetarian or the meat eater. 

The food here is bowl based. Start with a base of salad, rice or cauliflower rice (or a combination), add a base of beans, potatoes, rice noodles, then add your toppings - carrots, kimchi, corn, broccoli, kale, cheese, egg, and lots of other choices. Next is the protein - tofu, steak, chicken or spicy chicken. Last you can add a sauce. Or go without sauce - there is also a sauce bar where you can add the sauce yourself. 

They have chef bowls of predesigned meals. My wife goes this route. I always build my own. 

Use the app and get $5 off and build loyalty points. 

There are also many drinks and free miso soup. 

This is now one of my favorite restaurants!"

I had been waiting for it to open for about 2 months as I have been a regular at a location near where I grew up in Illinois. Having one close to downtown Indianapolis is a game changer! This is what I would consider the Asian version of a Chipotle but better. Super fresh ingredients, great options, and nice service! I love the sweet potato glass noodles and the chicken as the protein option. You can't go wrong with the toppings. I always load mine up with fresh Veggies. There is something here for everyone. If you're looking for a healthy and affordable quick dinner or lunch option this is the place!"
9NkJFaQQqgnl7GRr0d3lmA,Q3omBAwUi1TGicLNaRlB0Q,5.0,"An excellent, new fast-casual option in Keystone area! I first heard about it through a direct mailer I received, but ended up going there on a whim when I was in that shopping center running errands. The best part about this place, for me, is that it's 100% gluten free, and they're really great about announcing that in their signage! This is a build your own bowl type of spot where you have different bases, proteins, toppings and sauces to choose from. Everything is labeled really clearly so that you know exactly what ingredients are included in each option. It even tells you what the health benefits of each foods are, I love that!

They also have a mobile app and rewards program! Love me a good rewards/loyalty program.  Plus, miso soup and extra sauces are available self-serve for free!

The service - fantastic. The food quality - even better. I can't think of a reason you wouldn't want to eat here! The menu is unique and not something you can get everywhere. I will definitely be coming back. 

I ordered the BiBi Fan Favorite. This was so good it exploded with flavor and textures. The yum yum sauce is sooooo good. I also really like their drink selection and free miso soup!!"

fl-uWvqxcujHbujRp1OdxQ,K4DVDHmrSoz3QdVGwjrqaw,4.0,This place had a great selection of acai bowls and smoothies/juices. I had the Dragon Bowl. It was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. I also had the dragon smoothie. It had a different taste from the bowl however it had a very fresh and unique taste. I would recommend this place for a fresh and healthy snack.

mVlstEGXzDW95w_Ymn7jWQ,K4DVDHmrSoz3QdVGwjrqaw,4.0,"Vitality Bowl is hidden away in a less obvious section of Town Square. 

First visit and great first impressions. 
* Nice staff
* Acai bowl amazing. Did not know what to expect.
* Serloin Paninj tasty
* Kale salad not bad
 
---
If you have any type of acid issue (heart burn, reflux etc) BE CAREFUL. My meal was 1/2 kale salad (which had a lot of lemon) and kids Acai bowl. Both were delicious. 

I do not have much in the way of issues with heart burn or acid. I did notice what seemed like a lot of lemon on the salad (?). In about an hour, I thought I would wind up in the hospital. Searing heartburn the likes I have never experienced. Like two molten hot six inch plates, one pressing out from my chest while other pressing out from my back. Vomiting to release the pressure. This lasted for about two hours and thankful medicine was already in the house. 

So this is likely my reaction to so much lemon, or maybe having eaten both. Maybe a reaction to Acai (first time eating.) Love the Acai bowl so much I hope the issue was not a result of the bowl.Afraid to find out. 

Note: prices are often subjective so pricing not included in review"
JQUOaG07Ql6-itp7u_fGtQ,K4DVDHmrSoz3QdVGwjrqaw,4.0,"Had a nice smoothie here. Pricey but has a LOT of mixes and combos you can make. 
I asked for a recommendation based on what I was craving for and the employee matched it pretty well. 
They said the wait is about 15 min but it came out earlier than that. 
Come try it, and the area is beautiful too!"
Fp0NWIku-v0WWDpIZgQPDg,K4DVDHmrSoz3QdVGwjrqaw,4.0,Love this place! Enjoyed both their açaí latte and their superfood bowl. They have lots of interesting options. I want to go back to try them all!

The prices were good and I was pleased with the overall taste of the juices I got."
dL6NnlGLQAeqRA8y-7i5Bg,K4DVDHmrSoz3QdVGwjrqaw,4.0,"Really like the concept and having another healthier eating option in the town center is welcome.  Ordered the tropical açaí bowl.  Topped with bananas, coconut flakes, mango etc.  tastes great.  Portion size is good.  Great staff ready to explain your options.  The only thing is the price:  $13 for a larger sized bowl.  When meals at fast casual restaurants are typically $10, getting a bowl for more seems a little tough to swallow.  My suggestion is to get the kids açaí bowl."
2CyPd22oK-5KnfLgG-igGw,K4DVDHmrSoz3QdVGwjrqaw,4.0,"I've been wanting to check out Vitality Bowls since it opened, but didn't get around to it and honestly may not have found it if I had - I would have assumed it is part of the main Town Center building, but it's tucked away below the parking garage, next to LA Fitness. 

My husband and I stopped by to pick-up lunch while running errands.  The outside of the place is deceiving - it looks tacky, almost shady.  But, the inside looks very normal and was reassuring.  We quickly selected our bowls - the Nutty Bowl and the Tropical Bowl.  We made our way home and it was love at first bite.  I tried both bowls and they were so fresh and the flavors melded so well.  I was immediately relieved that our kids were at school because I knew I didn't have to share this goodness with them.   I'm excited to keep trying different flavors/types. 

I will say that the bowls are pricey and since they're made fresh, the wait is a bit longer than most fast-casual type places.  Had we been in more of a hurry I may have been frustrated, but we had just enough time on our hands to not mind the wait."

There are no added sugars, sorbets, or fake fruit juices in their smoothies/açaí bowls. Everything is sourced from REAL food. They also have the most extensive selection of superfoods and adaptogens I've ever seen! (Maca, spirulina, cacao, matcha, camu camu, acerola, moringa, and more...) Additionally, they offer amazing healthy food options, such as FRESHLY made paninis and salads. My sandwich and smoothie were both made fresh immediately after I ordered them. I truly feel like I can trust that my food was sourced from a top quality source and prepared with respect and care. Also, the staff here is simply wonderful! Very kind and inviting. It's obvious that they want you to have the best experience possible! 10/10. Definitely making this a regular spot! Highly recommended."

I was looking through the extensive menu for not even 30 seconds when one guy came out from the back to help me. I said I needed more time so he went back to what he was doing. Less than another 30 seconds later, another guy comes out to ask if I have any questions. Based on my preference, he recommended the Tropical Paradise smoothie (picture attached). The smoothie was really flavorful and had the perfect amount of sweetness. I devoured the smoothie in no time and didn't feel guilty because it's super healthy!
Awesome service and amazing smoothie. Would love to try their bowls next if I go back and have the time to sit but will definitely get the Tropical Paradise smoothie again!"

I don't typically like health food places, but this place values fresh and healthy food and is so good! I'm looking forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu. The selection of smoothies and bowls is endless! In addition, the workers were so nice and friendly.

Back to the soup. Wow! They have a homemade soup every day. It has been this thai curry rice twice. I am in love. The first time the owner came over and apologized for it. He said it was too thick. I said I will end you if you touch my soup. It is perfect in every way. Yes, a bit thick, but in a good way. More of a rice stew.
Just get the soup.
Trust me. If its thai rice curry get a bowl. Then get a to go cup.
Okay. Get a bowl too. I like the immunity bowl because I love ginger. 
Be aware that everything is made fresh, so be ready to wait 5-10 minutes for your order. Get the online app to save some $$$."

I liked the following.

The Matcha Madness Smoothie - this smoothie has organic açaí, almond milk, match, hemp seeds, Kale, dates and bananas. Love how this tasted. It was really good.

Veggie Panini - mozzarella cheese, smashed avocado,  sun dried tomatoes, Dijon, pesto spinach, red onion.

The bowl itself was amazing. Everything was very fresh and the flavors blended perfectly.  They have a lot of bowls so I will definitely be back for more. The man who took my order was also so nice.

From the first visit the staff has been incredibly warm, welcoming and friendly. Instead of just asking ""what can I get for you"" I am always greeted with a huge smile and questions that helped me find my smoothie fit. I cannot miss a trip here after the gym and it's not just because the food and drinks are consistently delicious but because of the staff. I'm sure I am one of 500 people that frequent this location daily but they always remember me? Marisa is Incredible. I work in hospitality and customer service for Marriott and it is so good to be on the receiving end at Vitality Bowls. As long as I live here I will always support them!"

It was their second day open and I was impressed with the modern, clean design. The store was extremely well-staffed. I appreciated that the owners were all stationed in the front of the store to walk you through the menu items and explain the benefits of the different ingredients. Everyone was very friendly and knowledgable. 

I ordered the Go Green smoothie, but also tried a lot of free samples they passed out including: the dragon smoothie, the kombucha on tap (lemon ginger flavor I think), and Hot CaCoCo. Everything was so so delicious. I LOVED the Go Green smoothie and it will definitely be a new go-to for me. 

I've already downloaded the app to place orders ahead, receive points, and a free bowl on my birthday! Overall I'm very happy this store opened as a good smoothie/juice bar was missing from Town Center. Major bonus that it is right next to the gym and there is plenty of parking in this big lot."

They make everything to order, so you may have to wait a bit, but it's worth it. My favorite items are the Vitality Juice (carrot, apple, celery, and kale) and the Kids acai bowl.

As I said the place is a bit small, maybe 5-8 tables. You can also carry out! 

I've only been here once and I can't wait to go back!

I had a strong craving for a açaí bowl and the one I got from here really hit the spot. 

I got the Vitality bowl. Base is Organic Açaí, Bananas, Strawberries, and Flax Seed. It's topped with Organic Granola, Honey, Bananas, Strawberries, and Goji Berries. It was about $11, which is pretty standard for açaí bowls. The ingredients were fresh and delicious.

Staff has always been amazing esp the operator and the tall African American gentlemen. Superb

Also I highly recommend the app if you are getting it to go. They are going to just get busier plus the reward structure is very simple and fair in my opinion eg you don't have spend a gazillion dollars to get something back.

I truly love the product, bowls, smoothies, and paninis. However, beware of which employee is working when you show up!  My experience with most employees has been noted by great customer service, smiles, recognizing me, as well as quick, accurate and friendly service. However, if you are unlucky enough to meet the wrong employee at the counter like I did on Friday evening you will likely get a half filled bowl for your trouble, and should consider yourself fortunate to even receive what you ordered. Also, beware you will have to remind these employees of any discounts and happy hour specials or you will not receive them. I'll still be there, but I hope the owner gets all of his employees (especially family) on the same customer friendly page! 
Ps my five stars are for the awesome employees that give 100%! You know who you are!"
tipA1VCLamjH1W_w-3cx8w,K4DVDHmrSoz3QdVGwjrqaw,5.0,"I discovered Vitality Bowls one morning after driving by my gym looking for a parking spot.  I can't lie, I'm in love with this place and especially with their house Thai Curry Rice soup speciality.  OMG, it's a mouth drooling bowl of deliciousness.  Albeit, it was a tad thicker today than it was yesterday...BUT...I've already been to this place twice specifically for that and their immunity smoothie.  

Their immunity smoothie is a tad tart & less sweet with its fresh ginger but I feel an immediate difference with this cold I've been battling after I drink it & bonus, it still tastes great (to me :)!) I mean it's not so green that you feel like you're drinking liquid grass and it's not bombarded with sugar or artificial ingredients that keep you bloated and sick.  I love that everything here is fresh, raw, organic and pure.  I'm waiting to stop by one morning (when I eat most of my daily carbs) to try their bowls out which look like epic pieces of culinary art. The kid bowls are also lower calorie options and probably just as filling if you're looking for a lighter option.  

Plus everyone there is super friendly and helpful.  I learned today about their app that rewards you for every purchase and their catering options for our office. ADVICE: Download it, it's super easy to use and I love the added convenience of giving them your phone number for your loyalty points rather than having to scan barcodes, etc like what you have to do at other establishments.   

Do yourself and your body a favor and just this place your business.  You and your taste buds won't regret it!"
SdXX07j4nTV8GbWUree3_g,K4DVDHmrSoz3QdVGwjrqaw,5.0,Vitality bowls is by far my favorite juice bar and smoothie place! I have been going here for over a year and a half and continue to highly recommend it to all my friends and family. The options and açaí bowls are amazing and menu is extensive! They only use the best ingredients and make everything fresh!! The only con is that sometimes it takes a couple minutes to make a bowl or smoothie especially when they are busy but that's what's expected when you order something from scratch and it is definitely worth the wait! The staff is very friendly and always helpful with any questions or suggestions. Cannot say enough great things about this place!
n6AVXrEWr5H4K91gvzbwuw,K4DVDHmrSoz3QdVGwjrqaw,5.0,I love this place. So fresh and delicious everytime. I love using the mobile pickup and that you can split a large order into 2!

But got myself and my husband two Acai bowls, I got the Maui with fresh coconut sooo good and my husband got the Jamaica. My only complaint was its a little pricey for the sizes. I understand you are paying for extreme good quality and I don't mind paying top prices, but the bowl was almost 10$ and was tiny. I ordered smaller sizes of the juices and was charged for the bigger ones, but they fixed it with no issues and were very nice. the smaller juices are 5$ and they were the perfect size and I love the reusable glass bottles. Will come back in the future and may try their cleanse program too."
a40y_aUo1wl5PaTskwEjgQ,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,4.0,"Located in a very nondescript plaza off Missouri Ave. Tons of parking though but definitely need some signage so people can see it from the street. I was looking for a light lunch option and Good Vibes is close to my work.

Chill, beachy vibe inside and the people working there were nice and helpful. Explained to me the different bowls/ingredients and they were able to sub an ingredient for me on the bowl I ordered. I ordered the Caladesi bowl and a Reefer juice to go. Both were very good. Acai was creamy and after mixing it all with the different fruits and crunchy granola- YUM. Juice is good and tasted fresh. Their glass bottles are so cute too!

This is a pricier lunch option than most. You get what you pay for though: fresh, organic ingredients and a healthier meal choice. But it filled me up and I didn't feel like crap for the rest of the workday and into the evening."
l7gEyBBmrOwQhJdlGYKXiA,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,4.0,Went in for the first time today and ordered a bowl. My bait complaint is that they clearly freeze or chill their fruit puree. I was very excited to dig in but when I did I found that it was more solid than it was smooth. It has the consistency of if you are to order a smoothie bring it home and freeze it to eat later. I've included a picture of what exactly I mean by that. Once I let it defrost I was very pleased with the flavor. I just wish the fruit puree was better.

From the moment we stepped inside it was like being transported to a calm oasis.
There's a lounge area with ample seating right when you walk in, and a couple tables as well.
The menu is printed on cards and most of the menu is also written on a board behind the counter.
Super friendly staff and overall pleasant atmosphere.
My date and I ordered cold pressed juices.
They were out of my first couple choices but it was fine because I found one that I liked the sound of even more.
I had the sunrise juice which consisted of carrot, orange, lemon, pineapple and turmeric. It was tart from the lemon but absolutely delicious. It seemed a little pricey ($11 for a 17oz I believe), but it tasted super fresh, and I was happy to pay because I knew it was made fresh by people who care about quality. 
My date ordered something with beets in it but she loved it as well.
We stayed for awhile to relax and never felt pressured at all.
Great overall experience and I will definitely be back for more juices."
dgFDl4A-uzxm9FK-Vr0vFg,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,4.0,"This place is okay. I came here because it was highly recommended by a friend to check it out. It's a cute little store front in the middle of the shopping center. It might be easy to miss so pay attention. Plenty of parking out front.  We walked in and were immediately greeted. We asked for suggestions on popular drinks/açaí bowls and ordered. I was hesitant to order an açaí bowl because of the reviews on yelp that I had seen but decided to try it for myself. 
I got the 16oz. It was small. I don't want to know what the 10 oz looked like. The açaí also seemed like it was pre frozen in ice cream form. No, not açaí ice cream but just served like ice cream. It was incredibly icey and hard to eat. The portion was small and I know I would have been more satisfied elsewhere. It wasn't even full. There was a lot of dead space. A little açaí, a tiny bit of granola (which was actually good), a pinch of almond butter and a quarter of a banana. If I come back, I wouldn't get another one. It would have been a good ""tasting"" or ""sample"" demo.
As for the juice, it was good. That's the reason I'm raring this place still so high after being disappointed. We had the shark bite. It was beet juice mostly with a sting ginger taste. Overall it was good. I would come back for the juice but would just leave the açaí bowls to somewhere else."
As3J_Lmairh-KTP_XtyJ5g,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,Great place! My friend and I were visiting from out of town and stumbled on this place of wonder! We had never been to a place like this and the worker explained to us the juices and other products sold. We bought a few juices and enjoyed an acai bowl! I will definitely be going back when I'm in the area again!

Delicious!"
AJ7cKHXJhhAYUqXyquQMJg,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,I love Good Vibes juice. I've tried a couple of companies online when I've wanted to do a 3 day cleanse. It never fails there's always a couple of the juices that I don't like and I can't finish them. Good Vibes has a great variety and i have enjoyed all of them. Really friendly and helpful staff.

The sweet lady at the counter made me feel like I was hanging at in my girlfriend's kitchen while I ate. The bowl was delicious and sweet. I grabbed a couple of juices, too, expecting these to be as delicious as my lunch."
pdaqad-E7TAY5CTriTErLg,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,Amazing!  So happy to find 'Good Vibes Juice'  Just might be my new favorite place!  Great vibe & excellent service...& absolutely delicious product!
PyIGV7mt2NFI-jCYxqV5hQ,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,Their juice and Acai bowls are awesome. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would recommend them over any other juice place.

I love that they use coconut meat instead of flaked. I have had acai bowls from other places and none have compared to the quality of Good Vibes.

g8P4C9__vsgFlwwGWwrANw,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"I've had my fair share of acai bowls. But Good Vibes  does them differently and in my opinion, the best. It's more like an ice cream, which is how I prefer my acai. And the granola is such a nice touch. If it wasn't so expensive and high in calories, I would eat one for breakfast every day. I usually get the rooker bowl, and sub strawberries for blueberries!"
MuX6dnV_ItfyL3s1IPWdSA,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"We stopped in after riding the train at Largo Central Park with our 1 year old son (which we highly recommend) and were searching for something refreshing. What else is there to eat after a hot June day in Florida besides an açaí bowl?!? This place hit the spot. Not only was the bowl delicious, but the decor and music was right up my alley. It's like I was transported back to my days growing up in CA. Clean, welcoming, with definite good vibes. What made me love this place even more was the owner, Taylor. He is passionate about what he does and truly wants to heal everyone around him the right way...with clean food.  Thank you for sharing your passion with us, Taylor. We'll definitely be back !"
uvKcCqgTeEvl1CEpkWJz5A,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"I just moved to the area and wanted an acai bowl, so I googled acai bowls. Good vibes was the first to come up and I'm glad they did! First and last place I'll need to try. I've tried, probably 3 or 4 different acai bowls and they're all amazingly good. Fresh ingredients and the acai is some of the best I've ever had. My girlfriend likes the juices and gets them often."
bvz8Tw-nRVtk_o1HT4CKFA,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"Very nice hippie vibe. My wife was craving acai bowl and it was really good. I had one the smoothies with blueberries, banana, coconut water and Acai. Very filling and tasty. City of Dunedin is really cute to walk as well."

I ordered the 16oz Jamaica bowl and decided to try pitaya this time. I got coconut on top instead of hemp seeds. I love that they use actual coconut chunks instead of coconut flakes. The flavor of the bowl was delicious and everyone else in the group I came with agreed. I do wish sizes were bigger for the prices though.   

Staff and customer service was great.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Largo."
Bx3EqeZpqwEh0c4nuWYXgg,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,Best pitaya bowls!! I have tried a bunch of places in Clearwater and south Tampa. This one is the best!

We must have suddenly caught GOOD VIBES when we made that choice because we landed at this amazing place where my husband and I have never had a smoothie that tastes so good and it was vegan, gluten-free!! I'm staring at my cup wishing I ordered a larger one. We will definitely return before we head back home. Thank you for your hospitality and amazing gift of nutrition!"
mnnQBkRB2gUxC1F_zZMu8A,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"The girls that worked there were super sweet and knowledgeable about their products. Good Kombucha flavors and the bowl was delicious.

euy4qfOa821lGCt9y445Bg,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"I ordered the melonhead cold pressed juice which is a seasonal drink with watermelon, apple and lime. This juice is made with raw organic fruit. This juice was refreshing and perfect for a warm sunny day in Florida."
msgGoV1ljP7rFxB_Q_y5QA,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"I chose the Indian Rocks Rd location and I ordered 2 acai' bowls at the take out window there. My bowls were filled with fresh fruit, granola & really tasty acai'. The staff working were friendly & helped guide my decisions about my order.  They were also informative about some questions I had regarding their fresh cold pressed juices. This location is convenient for parents who like the convenience of a drive thru. It also is close to many parks and the beach, so it's a nice treat to beat the heat."
NSWXHybJ1Xln_B_wAUiKLw,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"I've only had this from Uber eats so cant speak for the facility itself. The smoothie bowls are delicious!! I had the Maui bowl: blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, açaí sorbet (no added sugar), granola and cocoa nibs. Omg it was so good! I'm picky with my granola but their granola, which is grain free and nut free, was surprisingly delicious!! I would def order this again! Great quality, dairy free, no added sugar, but still full of flavor!"
7HzJBu6D14I2HUjic_LabA,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"Fantastic juice options -- always super fresh! I love coming here especially when I'm feeling under the weather, because their juices are packed with healthy ingredients to give your body a boost."

I order an açaí bowl quite often and they always have it ready to go when I ask for a specific time. They are friendly, kind, it's clean and the açaí bowl is always fresh and delicious. I'm so glad they are five minutes from my work!!!"
BtQuENSPcC6rYWlYVUvmZQ,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"Bomb food, prices are good and so far staff is friendly and polite. I wish they opened earlier so I could go before work for breakfast. Start opening up at 6!"
Nps43pEdPrnEdofcf3bYxw,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"If you want honest, fresh, raw, and organic juices and bowls, this is the place. No water, is added to the cold pressed juice. Many varieties to choose from. The health benefits from cold pressed juice are amazing, and Good Vibes is the place to get it. The açaí bowls are wonderful too. The caladesi is my personal favorite. Smoothies are also good, but I prefer the cold pressed juice. Don't be fooled by the crap at the grocery store or other places around town boasting fresh juice. This place stands by their word and the owners sincerely care that their customers are getting the best quality product on the market. Start out small with a pure fruit juice, then work your way up to the Goliath Greens or the Unity. Your body will thank you."
apzEwz63OQvqOLlLhHr6BA,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"I would have NEVER known about this place if my friend hadn't brought me an acai bowl one day. One bowl is all it took to get me hooked!  It's tucked away in a less-than-busy strip plaza without any eye catching signage from the street. I'm sure tons of people drive past it without ever realizing it's there. 

It's a good 20 minute or so drive for me but I don't mind. Yes, it's THAT good. 

Their acai and pitaya bowls have fun names with different fruit options, they are reasonably priced considering you are getting a generous portion of fresh fruit, and they taste absolutely AMAZING! 

Support local small businesses - they thank you for visiting and genuinely mean it. As I'm writing this review I'm thinkin I should go for breakfast. The Rooker is my personal favorite but you really can't go wrong with any of them because their flavor combinations are spot on, out of this world!"
K_8xERMidQrzTLdUTemDPA,RIN3ZEQmbqXh8ZYQ4efDTw,5.0,"Great place for Açaí bowls and juice! Not many options for bowls in the area and this place definitely did the job. Ingredients seemed really fresh and delicious. Customer service was amazing too. The guy that seemed to be running the place was super friendly and helpful when ordering a bowl. We came back the second day and he remembered us which was welcoming. 

Place is located in a weird empty shopping plaza and there's plenty of parking. 

Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a healthy spot for bowls or juice. My only criticism is the small bowl seemed a little too small but it was still amazing."
4qfXqtRFPtawuUigBJX-Xw,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,"As a new found lover of açaí bowls I've been on a mission to try them all over town. I was in the Seminole Heights area and decided to give this place a try and it did not disappoint. First off the place is so cute on the inside. Clean and spacious and I appreciated the library 

Food: the bowl was very good! I got the whatever bowl which was a blend of açaí mango and strawberries and I thought the flavors was delicious with all the fruits balancing each other well. There was a good portion of strawberries and bananas on top and the honey drizzle gave it a really interesting taste. The menu said there were coconut flakes but it was a teaspoon if not less so I barely noticed it which was disappointing. On the other hand you are given ALOT to granola. In the future I would prefer more coconut and less granola. In the end it was delicious and I will definitely be back! 

Side note: I would eat the bowl there because it was not as thick and wAtery by the time I got home. Still delicious!"
LIwy4BmSXjz_t_urLE1ukw,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,"Short: Whatever Pops is a decent spot to get desert if you're in the area and you have some money to spend. ~$8 for a milkshake is kinda pricy, but the quality makes up for it! I would recommend

Extra: I had the Captain milkshake both times I've been here, and it's really tasty! The ~$8 milkshake is pretty well made. Its a white chocolate based milkshake mixed with some syrup, whipped cream on top and sprinkled with Captain Crunch bits. The employees are also pretty friendly. Overall, it's a great spot to hangout, and I would recommend it to anyone."
MYI4LrEFTeR03pdDcSd5PQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,"These whatever pops are great. The guy has stand at most events in Tampa and I always know I can get a unique popsicle that tastes awesome. 

They are all natural and he has the coolest flavors. He also gives you a punch card every time you go so you can eventually get a free one."
Q4teoXajQOH7btJjmIh-_Q,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,"First time in and it was a good idea! Cute shop, lots of seating. The ladies working the night we stopped in were friendly and helpful with the menu. And patient! I couldn't make up my mind lol. We decided on their delicious gelato. I got the malted milk ball in a waffle cone and it was soooo good. Tasted just like a Whopper. Which I love! Only complaint is the waffle cone was leaking like crazy and I was trying not to make a mess everywhere. Suggestion would be to put something on bottom of cone like a marshmallow or seal it with chocolate like other places. Portions are generous, I got one scoop and it was A LOT of gelato.

They offer a lot of stuff here! Grilled cheese, waffles on a stick, acai bowls, smoothies, coffee, milkshakes, etc...and of course their pops. I don't frequent Seminole Heights too much but this will definitely be on my radar whenever I am in the area."
hj2gD6xPFMTZoLNRp-V3tg,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,"I'm not a huge popsicle person, but I've made a couple stops at this little cart. The lady manning it was super nice and gave me suggestions about what to try. The first one I tried was a coffee caramel and I could only taste the coffee. It was also weird having a semi dairy popsicle, so I'm not sure I would do that one again. The second time I saw the cart I tried a fruity one and enjoyed it a lot more. I will say I wish they had a bit more texture in their pops (at least the fruity ones, because that would make sense more than chunky coffee...), but I guess that's just how they choose to make them. I really loved their unusual flavor selections and wished I could try them all!"
597a75pJ04Y_hnIln6eP3w,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,"Stopped in for a very, very late lunch/snack last week and this cute place seemed like a good place, despite the cooler weather. I had a ""Better with Bacon"" grilled cheese sandwich and I have to say that it was pretty darned good. (IMO, the sandwich was better with the barbecue sauce dipper, which had a slightly funky flavor I spent a few minutes trying to identify, but couldn't. Tamarind? Anyway...) I walked away afterward with two scoops of ice cream and they were good, but not quite good enough to justify the price. 

I liked the food, but didn't love it. Would go back though and could see coming here for dessert on a date night."

Their ice pops are unique and tasty and their extra menu options at the store are great as well! The only thing that's a negative is it's kind of pricy for what you get, but I guess that's really everything around here."

Poxzil6EIePwzWmRAUMoQA,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,"I only come to this place when I need a good milkshake. I absolutely love the Hazy Chocolate and The Captain milkshakes. 

The Hazy Chocolate is a rich nutella and chocolate milkshake while The Captain is a white chocolate based gelato mixed with Cap N Crunch pieces. Anyone who enjoys Cap N Crunch should try The Captain because they certainly will not be disappointed. In the Hazy milkshake, the cup is dashed with nutella drizzle before pouring the liquid into the cup. Same thing with the The Captain except they use caramel instead of nutella. Even though these milkshakes are extremely decadent, they are pricey. They run about $7 each so I really only come here when I am splurging on my sweets. The restaurant also offers acai bowls, waffles on a stick and a few options of sandwiches. Because this place is kinda in the middle of nowhere, I wouldn't come here unless it was for their milkshakes or unless I was already in the area."
ql0nJIcuCRyP29ebryb8uQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,"I always love to visit this little shop for some yummy  and flavorful popsicle. These are great to cool down the summer heat in FL and almost any other days throughout the year. 

The shop has a variety of pops and it's so hard to pick and choose everytime I'm there. My favorite is banana coconut. And it's more than just pops here, you can find ice cream, milkshakes, acai bowls, grilled cheese, waffles, etc. 

The price is on a little bit above average and it adds up pretty quickly if you decide to dip for $1, roll or drizzle for $.75 each. I usually avoid the extras and I prefer plain, delicious pops."
I8fDx-hCH0jJR8mUFddm3g,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,"Definitely pop if you put your popsicle and sit for some time. It great summer to visit this place to cool off. We were going to try their waffles but their waffles machine was down. So we go for the popsicle instead. The price is about a bit above average. Not much of selection. But the selection is good enough to try. 

We have the watermelon citrus and salty chocolate Elvis. The watermelon citrus I have tasted some chop up fruit remains. It is refreshing. The salty chocolate Elvis is something good feeling. Soft to bite and easy let it melt. I can hear some Elvis music now from Graceland. Put some sun glasses I will be Elvis myself. 

They also offer dip or sprinkle. Dip it is $1, roll and drizzle is $0.75. Like I said they have waffles on the stick but machine was not operate that day. They also have grilled cheese, coffee and regular ice cream."

There are lots of flavor choices and a helpful staff to steer you in the right direction. They have other items on the menu for those that don't want something cold.
5OBaHag2FSJbOYQtVhv2Tg,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,Really good gelato. The sugar waffle cone makes it even better. Haven't tried their pops yet but they seem to have some really interesting flavor combinations.

Also worth mentioning that their mini free library is adorable & a great little addition! I wish more places did things like that."
jbFwxPNPgtcoTCFIUPSICg,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,"Came here with some friends when we were vacationing in Clearwater. If you drive too fast, you might miss the turn into their parking lot, but definitely hard to miss the bright green color of the building. The staff were super friendly and welcoming. Our group ordered 3 acai bowls and 1 ice cream. We also got to sample the ice cream they make in house (super yummy! loved the cookies and cream flavor). There's a large selection of items on the menu, from ice cream, popsicles, acai bowls, and more! The environment had clean, contemporary decor (very hipster-like). The restroom was also really clean! And they even had a little library corner for you to read. 

I would have given this place a 5 star if it wasn't for the consistency of the acai bowls. Although the flavor was great, the blend itself wasn't as thick as I would like. It was a little too watery for me. But I loved the fresh fruit toppings and especially the granola! Would definitely stop by if I'm ever in the area again. Loved my experience here :)"

Admittedly, I'm not really a popsicle person.  I spent last weekend at Gasparilla Music Festival.  Because I'm pregnant, I couldn't cool off with a beer (as I usually do).  I spotted Whatever Pops on the first day and decided that a Watermelon Citrus pop would be just the ticket to cooling off with a refreshing treat.  It was absolutely delicious and just what I needed.  The following day, I tried out the Lemon Cream.  I thought the second pop was even better than the first.

The gentleman working was extremely friendly and gave me a frequent buyer card.  The new location that Whatever Pops is opening in Seminole Heights is walking distance and I can safely say that I am now hooked and will be a frequent visitor of the location.  

Thank you, Whatever Pops, for providing my pregnant self with a cool treat on a hot day!"
TTMIOMIwNUZeAebAgJCwrQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,"What a great addition to South Seminole Heights!  We have needed a casual dessert place like this forever, and Whatever Pops delivers (although, they don't actually deliver, you know). The actual name on the storefront is Whatever Pops & Bowls-this Yelp listing was taken from when they just had a cart.

Their popsicles are delicious. They don't offer as many flavors as the other local popsicle place, but the ones I've tried are very good. I do wish they would mark somewhere which popsicles contain dairy, and which flavors don't. Currently, my go-to is chocolate sea salt. I also wish they carried a flavor or two that had a little spice to it-those have turned out to be my favorites at other places.

They also offer homemade gelato, smoothies, shakes, and waffles on a stick, but I have yet to try any of those.

The one other thing I've tried here is the Açai bowl. Since it's the first I ever had, I have nothing to compare it to, but I did like it. For those who are Açai bowl novices, their version is the Açai berry, strawberries and blueberries, cacao, then topped with granola and unsweetened coconut, drizzled with local honey, topped with more fruit, then almond butter. I'm sure I've left out or added some ingredients, but you get the gist.  Very refreshing.

They offer the whole punchcard thing, so make sure you get your card punched each time so you can get a freebie!"

I was going to try their waffle on stick but their waffle machine wasn't working that time. So I got a chocolate popsicle.  The name was salty chocolate Elvis.  It contained  chocolate, peanut butter and banana. It was a good combination of flavor and texture and wasn't salty or  too sweet. It was quite good .  The ambience there was relaxing and clean.  This is a good place to cool down during the summer time."
O55ABbglJXmmmnJAEhvdlg,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,4.0,My sister ordered a coconut-banana popsicle and shared it with me.

Best of all, the staff is super sweet and always helpful!"

zyxkmC_zCh1cLaw9tEZm1g,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,Their pops are amazing and so refreshing. I also tried their The Captain milkshake and it was delicious. I am definitely coming back to try their Belgian waffle on a stick.
DRqB9IMV98FPRfWqDY_6qQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"My company celebrated summer today with free iced treats from three vendors. I gravitated to the Whatever pop truck because I love popsicles in fun gourmet flavors. I love lime so I chose the coconut lime. It is so good! Creamy and also quite limey. A couple other people went with the earl grey lemonade pop and also raved about it. 

I would certainly stop by their store if in the area or visit their food truck if you see it out and about."
ooMRLQuOxTm8tRHBdu67fQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,Best gelato and ice pops around!! The staff is always very friendly and super helpful! From grilled cheese to milkshakes they have it all. You won't leave disappointed!

4YVh_M1vB9zWSgLxGxpSpQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,So good! So friendly! So many different flavors of popsicles and gelato. Loved my espresso and gelato mixed (arrogato?) and my acai bowl. Will be returning many more times!
10gETrnSbiCASU3sI3y3rg,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,Whatever Pops has some very unusual flavors; but I plan on trying a different one every time I attend an event.  I loved the cucumber flavored one and the banana pudding.  Well worth the $3.00!
lGk0B8vAgNojL9LfcplZAw,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,I have had their popsicles on several occasions and I was never disappointed. Love the fact that there is real fruit in their pops and the customer service has been friendly!
qSSBhP7Cv50td1_z5HdqxA,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"I've worked several food truck rallies and events with these gentlemen. Stand up guys and absolutely friendly every time. The cilantro pineapple is amazing and great on a hot day but let me talk about the pumpkin pecan cheesecake, it was a revelation! Probably the best pop I've had in my lifetime. If you haven't been, do yourself a favor and check them out."
bVm1GDHDQ40dOkaoWVDOkQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"Well I can't say anything bad about this place it's like Disney land and Willy wonka had a child and whatever pops out .... they have everything from gelato to acai bowls , waffle on a stick which has been my favorite so far 


And can't forget there homemade popsicles !!! A real treat any time if the year , (WELL IN FLORIDA WE CAN )  

Everyone's personality is very welcoming they are open to helping you decide on what you like and what you want to try ....


In closing try whatever pops and you will be pleasantly surprised ...  and they have a punch card after 10 you get a free pop what a great little welcome back surprise"
EMVQ7_zjMl8F9JhBTcMazQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"We kinda stumbled upon this place walking from a dinner place close by. Looked really cool so we walked in. They have all natural and homemade gellatos and popsicles. They're unique in which you can dip your popsicle in any kind of chocolate or caramel etc

The staff were very nice and place was really clean.

Wasn't necessarily unique but I give it the extra fifth star because it's clean, natural, and tasty.

I don't really have anything bad to say about it. 

PS - my friend got a waffle stick with a scoop of ice cream on the side and it looked to die for!"
L7fFSxAR4CX0W_I1PHoucg,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"Coconut Lime all the way!


I first was introduced to these delicious pops at the Hyde Park farmers market where they have small cart. They are $3.50 each and the ingredients are sourced locally as much as possible. 

The coconut line has been my selection twice in a row now and I Love it!! You can really tell its homemade with the punch of flavor you taste and right then you know it's not artificial! 

I was very happy to stumble upon their more permanent location at Duckweed market downtown Tampa at the Element building. Now I know where to go more regularly!

I would definitely recommend to anyone and the price is justified on a hot day walking around with a taste of happiness!!"
xHCshaPDTC5X3coWp1MFWQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,A friend of mine introduced me to acai bowls here a few weeks ago. Basically I'm just trying to figure out why I haven't tried one before  this place is awesome. Small & cozy but lots to choose from! I got the almond cacao bowl with raspberries & it was fantastic! They're pretty & they taste delicious!!  Everything else they had look amazing as well. Can't wait to come back for more! Highly recommend!
ncOxO-rof_p_AH1uAPB-pQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"I moved down to Tampa from the northeast about two years ago and Whatever Pops was one of the first local business I thought was such a great idea. They are portable so if you hear of a market or a food venue going on you are sure to spot Whatever Pops. With this FL heat it is a great way to cool down!

Their menu changes and they create great flavors with every season. One summer I remember being addicted to their sweet and refreshing cucumber mint! Last fall I was also in love with their pumpkin cheesecake (literally had some graham crumble at the bottom of the pop), orange was my boyfriends absolutely favorite. He told me it reminded him of his childhood eating orange creamsicles. My daughters favorites have included chocolate sea salt, strawberry mango (mango flavor molded inside strawberry), coconut lime and many more. They even make pops for pups. My dachshunds devoured that pop down to the popsicle stick.

Best of all Whatever Pops stays true to using local produce. 
Try them out and don't forget your punch card!"
b-mmd2s1GhxxCc-yOEBBTA,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"The last time I had their pops, their truck was at my office, this time I stopped in at their Florida Ave. location. 

I was having a crappy day and felt like I needed something fruity to help perk up my day so I went out at lunch and started heading north on Florida. I was planning to go to CVS to get some flavored water, and I spotted their store. I turned around, went back and went in. I remembered that their earl grey lemonade pop was a winner that a lot of my friends had before so that is what I got. Super good!

The shop has off street parking, and a few tables inside if you plan to eat there. They have more than Popsicles but I didn't even look at their menu.  

I will be back!"
lXULOABSeU3nLgifXCvsrg,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,Almond cacao bowl is my new addiction. It's ingredients are pretty standard but you can taste their freshness in their home made almond milk smoothie and their fresh toppings. We also had their toasted coconut gelato which was out of this world! Creamy and filled with bites of coconut. The space is modern with a rugged design like concrete floors and metal chairs. Great clean positive vibe.
RSQG1xm8X6LCBJa8XMeMgQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"5 stars to the best popsicle I've ever had.  $3 dollars for a coconut lime pop was a little steep but after trying one, I would pay more and I'd do it again.  The owner said that about half of their popsicles are dairy free too, the one I got had just a few ingredients and how he could manipulate those to make the it so delicious was un real.  So good!"
mJIE0S2m2EnmIKSMTuolPw,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"We went to the shop in Seminole Heights to have a gelato for desert. We loved it. Very nice service and a nice selection of flavors. Certainly we would go again. Since then I have had gelatos & grill cheese at their Sparksman Wharf location and the quality and service was also excellent 
Give it a try!"

My husband and I both got a homemade popsicle. I got coconut lime and he got earl grey lemonade. Both were delicious! Also the customer service was great! Definitely will be back."

Z77gY-Z03uIKyukVZsqsXQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,Great service and gelato definitely coming again. The shop is near consignment shops and a cute bakery. Great area and great shops.
28uWxPsI0jhCnZKpuUAEAg,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,Amazing ice pops! These are some of the best I've ever had in the country. They have such interesting flavors. I especially love their lavender lemonade and blackberry green tea. I still regret not getting the chocolate peanut butter zucchini pop that I saw once.
amsK0EyruRy9okmKriIylw,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,Love this place. I enjoy the pops and shakes. Cute little space  few tables if you want to sit in. The people are friendly and the quality  of my pop and shakes are so good. It's my cheat place for sweets  and a good place for  healthy eats when I'm feeling like it gotta love that.

qKRg348J0P-nuuyU7gk8Wg,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,I love this place. From their pops to their milkshakes. Their bowls are amazing. My favorite one would have to be the whatever pop. The staff is friendly and super helpful. I will definitely return.
PyEbU4MUIKPvapRkv-b9og,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"THE ABSOLUTE BEST PLACE to get popsicles in Tampa. That's saying a lot coming from a person that doesn't really have a sweet tooth. Only all-natural, fresh ingredients are used which make these popsicles far more delicious than any popsicle you can buy at your local grocer's. The flavor combinations are unlike any you will find anywhere. With flavors like Pineapple Cilantro and Riesling Pear, it's always an adventure for your taste buds. My personal favorites are Arnold Palmer and Coconut Lime.

If you haven't had one of these amazing popsicles yet, then you're definitely missing out! They're great on one of the many hot Florida days."
0S1DiXNDYWcJr-e6prSdKQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"It was my first time trying an ""Acai Bowl"", and I thought it was pretty good. The presentation of the bowls were very cute. Since it was my first time, I wasn't sure how they were suppose to taste, but I enjoyed it a lot. I felt so healthy after eating one!
They also specialize in ""pops"" and have home made ice cream as well. The ice cream sample was delicious. I normally would have gotten ice cream but I wanted to try something new so I went for the acai bowl and it didn't disappoint! 

This place is a little hidden, given the location of the store in a random place in Tampa. They also had a cute little green wall on the outside and my friends and I had fun taking pictures outside the store as well."
ov9Dg-CAd8cvYDybGjPxFQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"I am a super fan! I absolutely love Whatever Pops and would eat a few of them in a row if I could. They have so many different flavors and when I say many I'm talking about 10+ more flavors at a time. I love their Honey Blackberry Green Tea and Blueberry Pomegranate Green Tea popsicles a lot, but there's tons to choose from. Super nice people and delicious and natural treats for you and your dogs."
VfmuMrt4zzJA2mk4eitOCw,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"I absolutely love this place! It's such a cute place and the popsicles are AMAZING! 

The staff is super friendly and helpful. One super cool thing that I liked about the dining area was that they had a little free library under the counter that houses the napkins. You can take a book and/or leave a book. I love that they brought this great concept into their storefront.  The whole place is pretty small so if they're busy, seating and parking may be a hassle. But it's definitely worth it! 

The popsicles are so delicious I could eat them all day long. I had the Earl Grey lavender lemonade popsicle and it was so flavorful and delicious. There are so many great sounding flavors, it was hard to choose just one to try. They have so many different items that sound and look amazing but I have yet to try them. I will definitely make sure I do the next time I come around."
tJO33ziwiImYEiOGS7146w,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"I was pretty excited to come to Whatever Pops ... Until I got here then I was overwhelmed! So many choices... Given my allergy restrictions however it narrowed it down but still I was so impressed with what they had to offer! I wish they had some coconut milk or almond milk ice creams or gluten free waffles on a stick.

Yep that's right waffles on a stick the place is impressive and a gourmet ice cream experience. Or if you want to stay on the healthier side they offer Gluten Free acai bowls that are pretty tasty. Definitely a place worth trying out if you haven't yet!"
co1Jdp7_SyR8wnDv2Z8z6A,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"Tried this for the first time at the Grilled Cheese Festival and I gotta say, I thought it was amazing. There were so many flavors, I had a hard time picking. I ended up with strawberry mango and coconut banana. The strawberry mango was refreshing and tasted amazing, I thought it was sweet but in a natural type of way. The coconut banana was very creamy and light in flavor. Overall, it was smooth, but I thought it was kinda boring. But it did resemble a nice vanilla alternative, so I was still very content. I can't wait to try all of the other flavors, I sure, they will taste just as amazing!"
RGJ8awKGRSsbxGjnMTef0g,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"Omg, I'm in love with you. I'm obsessed with you. I need more of you! The banana pudding with organic 'nilla wafers was what popped my first Whatever Pops popsicle cherry, and now, I must have more! But where are you? I can't find you. I need to stalk you on Twitter first. Oh the agony! But it only makes me want you more. More. More. More!"
XtwiH1vjMG_jt-RN2prTuw,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,Delicious and refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer day.  Flavors are creative and variety ensures there's something for everyone in your group.

Seriously the best lattes ever. And the this was our first time eating acai bowls and they were super delicious! We didn't get Popsicles since the bowls filled us up like crazy, but plan on going back for them. Excellent work guys!"
ZmpOL2IfcJmz0RhCaesRsQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"I was super excited to see a 'Whatever Pop' stand pop up in the Westchase Saturday Fresh Market this. I immediately bee-lined for the stand and asked for permission to take photos before I placed my order.

The man was incredibly friendly and accommodating! 

I had the hardest time picking a flavor because everything sounded delicious! My brother ordered the Cucumber Lemon and I ordered the Riesling Pear.

Both were delicious! His pop's consistency was harder and ice like whereas mine was creamier because of the pear.

The man was kind enough to punch two holes in the business card / reward card. He informed me that the 10th pop is ALWAYS free. Great customer service and super kind. He told me to be sure to check social media to see where they will be 'popping' up next.

Definitely a wonderful treat and only $3 a pop!"

We had never been, but my friend had already tried their popsicles from one of their carts.  Well the bowls were super delicious! The staff is qwesome, super friendly and the space I so super cute.  We also got regular drip coffee and added their homemade almond milk which was so delicious!! Definitely will be back."
v9NLLfdT497hkZGnmFRrdg,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"Holy. Smokes. This place is amazing. I had seen their Cap'n Crunch shake on Instagram and knew I had to have it. Popped up on a Sunday evening with a friend for some dessert - she had a large gelato (3 scoops) and I had the shake. Both were fantastic. Her cookies 'n cream gelato was incredible. My shake was fantastic, albeit very sweet. Just wish they had some outdoor seating other than a little bench!"

It was very creamy and flavorful. Prices are moderate. Overall I will definitely be going back and I recommend to everyone!"

My go-to favorites are the almond açai bowl, the chocolate+nutella milkshake, and the Salty Elvis popsicle (peanut butter, banana but mostly chocolate). Staff is always extra-nice and helpful! If you're an açai bowl fan, this is the best in Tampa. If you've never tried one, you're missing out!!!"

Did not think I'd ever write a review about a popsicle, but if you pass it, you should absolutely stop and you will be impressed. We tried the Earl Grey Lavender Lemon and another that was Banana Coconut. Both were fantastic and we'd recommend Whatever Pops to anyone!"

Also liked the Cookies and Cream gelato in a cone.  Somewhat limited seating, has some seats against the front wall and only 3 tables.  Our party of 7 still made it work.   Plenty of parking on the side and in back of the building.  I'm looking forward to coming back to some other flavors, also the grill cheese and acai bowls"
Zka-kZ7uVFs8TS4Lo0E-2Q,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,Becoming the new go to spot. For desert when i in the heights. This  is my 3rd maybe 4th visit have not been let down yet. The popsicles have interesting flavor profiles the sea salt and chocolate is one my favorites but hands down the waffle on a stick with malted milk balls gelato drizzled in dark chocolate is the best. Will definitely worth a trip if in the area. My only knock on this place when they get busy is the limited seating especially in a group.
Yvfe6ck2WU_dxOIJNb6whQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"Whatever pops'  almond cacao bowl is hands-down the best açai bowl in town.  I usually call it in, pick it up, and it's ready when I get there."
hbe0GE7oM9snusjJiJSYtw,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,Ok I'm hooked on the coconut and lime pop its creamy smooth pieces of coconut and the hint of lime sets it apart. What a burst of flavors in your mouth to cool you off on a hot day or just because lol because I really had no reason to have a pop but whatever pops!!!
BnimAx-v4nINFnWZpWcymg,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"I first tried one of these popsicles at a mac 'n' cheese festival in downtown Tampa - it was the Coconut Lime flavot and it was incredible! Creamy texture that tasted just like fresh coconut and a subtle zest from the lime. I was so impressed that I had to seek them out afterwards to try more!

Their actual store location is right off Florida Ave. It was a little confusing figuring out where the parking is at, and I ended up parking in the lot of a neighboring business. The inside was bright and open, and their staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Their menu has way more than popsicles too - from smoothies and shakes to various acai bowls to waffles on a stick! I switched it up and got a waffle on a stick with strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate drizzle, and it was divine! The Belgian waffle batter is dense and moist, so it doesn't need to be doused in syrup or sauce - just the accompanying whip and drizzle were perfect, along with the fresh strawberries.

All in all, a cool little spot with fresh and interesting offerings - I will definitely be back to try more!"
7ldyA_QPefIRdXiDuzabqA,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"This is a cute place and has very good food. The waffle on a stick is so underrated! Also, the bowls are very good, my favorite is the almond Cocoa.

I get one when I arrive to the market and one before I leave. I've tried to hit every flavor, shout out to: coconut cream, lavender, cilantro pineapple, lemon cream, cucumber lemon, coconut lime, orange creamsicle...gosh there's even more...One punch away from a free one!

The owner is incredibly nice too. He was leaving a food truck rally the same time as I and I needed a jump for my car and he helped me out! Can't wait for my next taste."
vOXOJzypiEdRvm4_Bij67g,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"Great unique flavors! Especially in the hot Florida sun, this is a must!  You will usually see them at out door events like local fresh market days, Fall fest, food truck rally's, and etc.  Some flavor combinations sound strange but in Popsicle form it works! It makes for a refreshing snack.  They also offer doggy pops, which are mostly based on a peanut-butter ingredient. As a frequent customer, I have collected many stamp cards and redeemed my free Popsicles whenever I encountered this portable stand. From what I recall, all the ingredients used are natural.  #Refreshing"

I just wanted a taste of a sweet and not consume a huge amount of calories so that was perfect for me. I talked to a worker (perhaps owner?) and she was super friendly. We had a great conversation and I learned that all of the pops are made on site, so it's the real deal. Others were walking out with Acai bowls and all sorts of goddies that looked out of this world. It's a clean, hip, friendly place that is well worth a try. Parking wasn't an issue at all!"

He's currently in the Duckweed health market so don't go crazy looking for him like I did! The store is located on the corner of Tampa & Polk Av. The unique flavors are amazing, organic (no corn) & delicious! We will be back for sure & these pops are something you do not want to pass up!"

Looks like there are lots of good items on their menu but I can't bring myself to trying anything else besides the bowls and the popsicles. I'm not sure what granola they use but it's my favorite by far, and the açaí bass is delicious. Only downside is it melts quickly but I don't mind, if I don't eat it all in one sitting I can freeze it for a bit and it's great again!"

I recently went on a popsicle binge with trying a coconut lime, strawberry mango and watermelon citrus. My subsequent brain freeze was totally worth it!

Pick up one at the new Duckweed Urban Market or at your nearest food truck rally."

I got the salted chocolate Elvis (salted chocolate with bananas and peanut butter) dipped in dark chocolate (maybe a little too salty). It was very good, however I think the fruit flavors are better. They have home made Gelato which they let you taste test. It was also excellent. They have waffles on a stick with toppings. It looks like the type of place where everything is good quality and worth the drive to get there."

Made with real fruit and fruit juices they are a frozen delight that goes well in the Sunshine State. I had a strawberry mango popsicle and it was as good as the name sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to get a picture before devouring mine, but that should tell you how good it was. I will definitely be back for seconds and thirds."

They basically sell gourmet ice pops in all sorts of flavors -- some are more traditional and some are a little bit more eccentric. I'm really glad to see something like this in Tampa because when I used to live in Durham, NC, there was a store with a similar concept that I loved called Loco Pops. 

Whatever Pops moves around and you can keep updated on their whereabouts through their facebook page. I get really excited whenever I see them at an event -- I've seen them at some food truck events and farmer's markets, but the most exciting time I saw them was after finishing the Hog Wild Mud Run. After running miles in the brutal sun and sludging through mud for over an hour, a Whatever Pop was just what I need -- so delicious and refreshing. They have the most unique flavors that change regularly... I've had Riesling Pear, Cucumber Mint, Strawberry Shortcake, Pina Colado, and some others that I can't remember, but I haven't had one yet that I didn't love! They also have one of those punch cards where after you buy 9, you get your 10th free!"

With the Florida weather, who doesn't regularly need a fruity frozen popsicle? 

Their açaí bowls do not disappoint- they're huge! I enjoy getting extra granola to add some more crunch. 

Also shout outs to the hearty smoothies and delicious grilled cheese combos. 

I haven't had their ice cream (including newly added vegan soft serve) but I'm sure it's as tasty as everything else."

Don't ""whatever"" me on this review, because I am so serious. This place is wholly amazing. It's quirky and full of personality, and holds one of the best açaí bowls I've had to date. I take my açaí pretty darn seriously, and I don't give out compliments like that lightly. But this was so FRESH, so bursting with flavor and just perfect. I wish I lived closer so that I could stop by at least several times a week just for the bowls.

The grilled cheese was fantastic too- again, just so fresh and real and setting the standard for how a grilled cheese should be. The coffee was okay, and I was so tempted to try literally everything on the menu. Waffle on a stick? Come onnnn. Whatever man, I am certainly coming back for more!!"

What a lucky coin flip because this place is wonderful. I ordered one scoop of caramel crunch gelato and a waffle on a stick with local honey. My coworker ordered a make-your-own açaí bowl with mango, pineapple, strawberry, kiwi, blackberry and Nutella and an iced coffee. When I say there's no bad choice on the menu, I whole-heartedly believe that. Staff are super friendly. Store is clean. Menu boards are beautiful and easy to read. What a hip little hole in the wall.

   ---   ---   ---

While this is technically a review update, my old review of Whatever Pops was for when I'd see their cart at food truck rallies or farmer's markets. This is not just a cart with a few gourmet popsicles, this is like my adult version of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.

Okay... this is not a very large building, so calling it the chocolate factory might be a bit of an over-sell. But I could not believe how much variety can be found here! I truly thought it was just a place for popsicles, but it's far more than that.

In addition to the pops, you can find some amazing ice cream, milkshakes, smoothies, acai bowls, grilled cheese, waffles and coffee! I feel like they should change the names to Pops & Whatever.

While I was incredibly tempted by the ice cream with caramel, I opted for a mango and orange pop, which was as delicious as every other popsicle I've had in my countless Whatever Pops experiences over the years.

I will definitely be back here many times to try the other gems on this menu. I'm obsessed after one visit!"
rxnpO5iJiqUcgMlVxLkulQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"Awesome!! The gelato was really good; smooth, creamy, I bought pints to bring home! BUT - you HAVE to order The Captain!!

mK4tK9bCO5cZYY6i5a47UQ,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"For a tiny spot, this place packs a big punch! From their interesting combinations of flavors in their ice pops, to their acai bowls, to their gelatos, to their glorious waffles on a stick, there's something for everyone here! 

It's a cute little dessert spot that also serves espresso. Perfect for a pop in when walking around in awesome Seminole Heights. The service is always friendly and the place is always clean. Love it!"
pSDliUieRHXvb_drvgJaOA,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"Why 5 stars? Because these popsicles are serious.

I have a serious popsicle problem. I once at a 100-pack of Pop-Ice's in less than two days. When I buy a 12-pack of those Philly Swirls from Publix... it is absolutely a ""one-sitting"" occasion. I think popsicles are God's way of saying that he loves us.

Whatever Pops delivers a high-quality product. If Philly Swirls are Mich Ultra, these are a Belgium dubbel. You couldn't eat twelve in one sitting, because they're just too rich for that kind of keg-standing.

Whenever I see Whatever Pops out at a food truck rally, it's required shopping. I highly recommend you do the same."
ZvhjkRpyfoIK9iC3wnIwBw,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"One of my favorite places in Seminole Heights!   The inside of this place is just so cute.  There are plenty of tables inside and a couple benches outside if you want to eat here.  

As far as the food goes, I am seriously addicted to their acai bowls.  I think I probably stop in once a week for a bowl.  I loved all three of their bowl options.  I usually gravitate towards the Whatever bowl which has light and fruity base, although sometimes I will get the cacao bowl which has a hint of chocolate in the base.  They have a lot of different toppings which are all are spot on - fruit is fresh, granola is crunchy and the honey is local!      

I will also come in here for some gelato or a pop.  My favorite pop is the earl grey lavender lemonade.  So yummy!  Whatever pops is a great place a sweet treat or a light breakfast/lunch acai bowl!"
RkoCSBKVJA38DFqS3QEgzA,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"Really enjoyed my two visits so far here. They have tons of options here. From coffee, to ice pops, to smoothies and to grilled cheeses. I've had their pops many times and they are quite delicious on a hot summer day. These last two times I've gone tho, I've gotten almond butter Acai bowls. They are decent sized bowls full of flavor and fresh fruit. For the prices they have, you can't go wrong with whichever bowl you pick. Filling and tasty for sure. The girls at the counter are friendly and lively, and explain the menu to you if you have any questions. I'll def keep coming back as long as the quality and the service keeps up. Looking forward to trying out the grilled cheese next time as I'm a HUGE grilled cheese aficionado."

I had the coconut lime one which was interesting and refreshing. My son has the strawberry mango and devoured it. My wife had the raspberry one? Can't remember the entire name. She enjoyed it but she did say it was a bit sour. And my friend had a milk shake and drank it with no regrets. 

I'd totally come back"
GtObnnInXfbrO0DQG5sKxw,EsV50Yt0y2y5PDYfTzmGCA,5.0,"I has such a great first experience here a month ago I wanted to make sure I came back to tell everyone they should feel good about patronizing a place like this. I was visiting my best friend for thanksgiving and was just walking around the area. I was on the hunt for coffee but had no real place in mind and stumbled across whatever pops - I lingered for maybe a minute to check the menu online before the owner (I assume) popped his head out to invite me in. They weren't even open yet! They were so sweet and didn't have to do that but did, provided excellent service thereafter and their selection is vast and cool! I'll be back from NYC to visit the area in a month and I'll be getting another coffee, green smoothie, plus a popsicle"

We were greeted and received an explanation of the options immediately upon entering. It was nice and clean inside, including the bathroom. Some photos to go with the menu would be nice, but the ladies explained everything pretty well. The parking area was ample, although you can't see your car from inside the building, because it's on the side. 

The prices seemed good for homemade items. I personally don't think $4 for a hand dipped homemade popsicle is asking too much. I definitely recommend Whatever Pops!"

Love the art painted outside! Perfect for instagram photos 
 
Here are a few things i absolutely recommend 

- Their grilled cheeses 
(Now you may say why would I spend money on a grilled cheese but THESE ARE TO DIE FOR. Haven't found better ones) ( they make their own sauce and pesto!)

-whatever bowl
(Super refreshing and filling. I don't think I have ever been able to finish one)

- ANY of their pops! 
( homemade!,  made with REAL fruit 
top favs are = mango orange, chocolate sea salt, the classic strawberry mango, earl grey lavender)

- gelato! 
( you really can't go wrong with any flavors! And the toppings are endless. From choc drizzle to fruit toppings)"

KYVwgAywDaYxITHRhpINPw,iW3Jo9r_y671fXCBa3uXeA,4.0,"I love this place not only for their fruit smoothies, but their wraps as well. I had some sort of wonderful chicken wrap in a spinach tortilla. It had very fresh ingredients, and was put together tightly, so it held together well all the layers of goodness inside. I would imagine all their other wraps and bowls are fresh as well. 

This business prides itself on everything being sugar-free, all natural sugar fruit smoothies, and they are good. I suggest adding a wheatgrass or peanut butter shot to beef up your smoothie and you'll have some good healthy and tasty, clean energy for awhile.

But I'm truly torn. The people who work here can be a little rude sometimes. They have been hit or miss. Customer service could be improved, as it seems there is never any adult supervision (management) lurking here, only high school and college students. It wouldn't prevent me from coming back, because their products are always delicious and clean. 

Also, price is very high for a small smoothie by the time you add what you need, which is too bad, because a small drink is slurped down in 5 minutes. But they sometimes have a buy one get one 50% off, which to me isn't much of an incentive.

Still, their wraps and smoothies rock!

My favorite smoothie is Nectar of the Gods. I'm also loving the Krazy Kale smoothie. It was suggested that I add ginger to the smoothie. It was a good suggestion. It really made me feel good all day. 

If you're not sure what you want, just ask them. Tell them what you like. They know what combinations work best together."
XiQcRgzyRVEsSfQINYpefQ,iW3Jo9r_y671fXCBa3uXeA,5.0,They were friendly and knowledgeable. I ordered the vegan wrap and a smoothie that originally comes with whey protein but I requested the pea protein option instead. I'd recommend adding another fruit that you like or a natural sweetener to customize the smoothie better to your desire because the protein cuts the flavors a lot lol. All of all great service and food while on the go.

CEjK4jcqegGwQ_QvgeN_3g,uQaXrr2sCyCD8dt-RdFrhg,4.0,"Green roots cafe has a great atmosphere. The place is small, and your forced to hear everyone else's conversation around you.

This place reminds me of my hole in the wall coffee shop (much nicer interior here) I used to work at previously, which brought me good feelings.

While here, I purchased an ice coffee and it ran me $3. I actually thought that was a pretty good price. I asked how much a can of la croix was and was given $3.20. I can't even fathom paying $3 bucks for a can of water.

Anyhow, good prices for coffee, just not their canned beverages."
1s4dra74AWKjgrgB2Kp2lg,uQaXrr2sCyCD8dt-RdFrhg,4.0,I came to Greenroots before a day at the Aquarium. It was around 10am on a Monday and it was empty. I ordered an iced coffee with almond milk and avocado toast with a poached egg. The iced coffee was good! I could have done without the avocado toast. It was on a protein bread and the avocado was fresh. There wasn't much flavor and it was topped with a spice that didn't add any kick. I got a poached egg too and it was really fried more so than poached. I would come back to get a coffee!
_QFaluunglQl-pztignlTA,uQaXrr2sCyCD8dt-RdFrhg,5.0,"We happened upon this little cafe when we left the aquarium.  I wanted to grab a quick bite before we made the drive back to Orlando.

We ordered the Caesar salad with chicken and Root Salad with chicken.  They were out of salmon and we're not big on beef.  I also ordered the Green Latifah smoothie.

The salads are LARGE.  And really tasty!  My 3.5 yo daughter ate almost half of my Caesar!  The root salad was really good, a great variety of flavors.

The green latifah was the bomb!  I wish I had ordered the bigger size.

The young woman behind the counter was a local paying her way through college. We had a nice little conversation before we left.  

The one bathroom was clean but no changing table.

The space is cute. A big comfy leather couch and a couple of small tables. Infused water is available for free."

Smoothies are perfect without a ton of added sugar and the ultimate avocado toast is to die for. Everyone who works there goes out of their way to make sure you are happy with your orders and the are always very friendly. The prices are great. I would eat here every day if I could.
NKxCET5WDsn3JZYCEdFkPA,uQaXrr2sCyCD8dt-RdFrhg,5.0,"Greenroots Cafe is my go to spot for a smoothie while I'm in the downtown Tampa area. The staff are always friendly and helpful. The cafe offers a wide variety of items including tacos, smoothies, bowls and salads. Lots of the cups, straws and bowls are made from recycled materials and are compostable.  My go to item is the Chunky Monkey - chocolate almond milk, banana, spinach, peanut butter, cacao, protein and agave. The smoothie is filing and delicious. I enjoy frequenting this local eatery & look forward to my next visit."
VVP9Macl4FGWzR3E3T2pNw,uQaXrr2sCyCD8dt-RdFrhg,5.0,"After strolling around the Channel District on a warm Saturday afternoon, our group was eager to find a place to eat.

A few places were crowded and a couple just did not seem to strike the right chord to make us want to pull out a chair and chow.

Then we happened upon Greenroots Cafe. This street front cafe is located on a busy corner and I doubt that we would have spotted it if we had been driving by the intersection. Fortunately we were on foot and decided to go in and take a look.

This is a lovey, light-filled space that specializes in smoothies, Acai bowls, salads and even tacos. The ingredients are fresh, the combinations are delicious and the concept makes it easy to add nutritious proteins, super foods and more to your meals.

Everything is made to order so a little patience will be well rewarded. There are plenty of options on the menu so items can be customized according to what, if any, proteins, for example, you want added.

Portions are filling and prices are quite reasonable. 

Select from the chilled beverages stocked in the case near the cash register, opt for born-in-Tampa Buddy Brew coffee or try to decide from the tempting smoothie combinations offered.

This is my kind of place. It is casual enough you can comfortably swing by post-run or while out on a walk. The prices make it affordable to eat good, quality dishes that are packed with flavor. And you likely won't leave hungry but really satisfied and already planning what to order on your next visit.

I celebrate a business that is helping folks to get and stay healthy. And I applaud the socially conscious touches like the paper, not plastic, straws.

Keep on the lookout for additional Tampa Bay locations and help to get the word out about Greenroots Cafe."

The location is beautiful and open, lots of space and all of the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable on different smoothies for different needs/interests. I also got the charcoal juice (I think it's called the cure) - I want to drink this juice all day/everyday, its so hydrating!! I took a green juice backpacking and it was a great refresher post hike. 
I tried one of the wellness shots as well - the immune shot, instantly made me feel vibrant and zingy.

I was surprised by all the amazing options. Each juice is organic, no added sugar, and they tasted amazing.

tBqrqAivwQNUJXPZ8_SfHQ,tsAFZdq3sSMwweieMXnhpQ,5.0,"This is a great business. I love that it's family owned and they truly care. I am here probably 2 times a week. I also have had a professional conversation with the owner Jess at one point, and you can tell the hard work and passion her family puts into  Boise Juice. Makayla has served me multiple times; is professional and friendly. Their products are great, and they have an easy accessible nutritional fact chart online. I am disappointed to see people leave reviews about how thick the smoothies are. They are suppose to be that way. Ask for a spoon then. They are using whole ingredients and not some watery sugar filler that makes your typical ""smoothie"" that expected consistency. Also, disappointed in someone leaving a review about non maskers. How is that Boise juice fault? This is a private owned business whom is trying their hardest. All the employees are wearing masks. They are sanitizing. Do you think the teenagers that are taking your order should haul out a whole family or adult for not wearing one? Don't you think that's a bit uncomfortable for the employees? From a business stand point, just leave. If you are concerned about getting exposed- you shouldn't be in a business- you should be doing curbside or Ubereats. Don't leave a bad review because you think they shouldn't serve ""rebels"", and you felt uncomfortable . Leave a review on the quality of the product ; not the personal issues you have with how you think the virus should be handled. Also- try emailing Boise Juice; they have a great access form on their website if you have a concern. Leaving a bad review over something that could be handled with management - is much more beneficial for both parties. Sincerely , a fellow business owner."

Called in to place the order - next time I will use the app.  We had to wait a bit for our order to be ready, but we didn't give them much time.  Everything was delicious.  

I am not from the area and especially appreciated the spirit behind the mask wearing here.  I could tell that that they simply respect people's freedom of choice on the matter.  Being from another area, seeing this kindness and respect for personal choice without turning it political or getting belligerent (everyone has a reason why they do or don't wear masks, right?!) was a breath of fresh air. Stay kind Idaho!  You wear it well!"

Sometimes it takes a minute to get your order because everything is made fresh except for the juice in the cooler and the snacks. If there is something you need or want that's not on the menu they will help you create your own personalized juice or smoothie based on what your health needs are. Love the paleo cookies too because I have had a hard time finding a good tasting paleo dessert. One of my favorite drink is getting their cocopro blended with pineapple and bananas so it's a smoothie instead of a juice. Soooo good. Highly recommend.

What sold me was the  service! The ladies were so helpful."
QM1FiuZtUD4uenAHJpIE4Q,D55f0Ahi5i3P_UUBWXWnFA,5.0,So happy to have a juice bar nearby! I was driving in Belle Meade this morning and had to stop by. I absolutely love their açaí bowls. Try it with dragon fruit! Very good. Customer service was great as well.
_LkB9EPynIB1sHV_wj27lA,D55f0Ahi5i3P_UUBWXWnFA,5.0,Love this place. I'm here frequently. I recommend the pineapple greens. My only caveat is that it's an expensive habit. Truly delicious juice  and always friendly service.
oMXmrbSyGyiU_FeM_N1LRA,D55f0Ahi5i3P_UUBWXWnFA,5.0,I love this place! The juices are fresh and flavorful and the customer service is great. It's my go-to juice place when I can't make my own at home.

You can tell they use fresh ingredients in their stuff. To be honest, they taste like those real deal once-a-week cheat day drinks you'd get at a cafe or ice cream shop. Mint To Be and PB&J are currently my fave ones so far. 

Their almond butter sandwich and pad thai noodle bowl are really good, too. Highly recommend!"

Honestly fresh and tasty, there was only 1 guy there taking orders and making them, so took a little bit, but well worth the wait & he was super friendly & kept letting me know it was almost ready. I got an açaí bowl, the cantina & a juice...alive I believe it was called, I added blue spirulina & CBD for an extra $4. I'll be back for sure"
nQf1_q2_5qjvmH8ZpuMy1A,8j3oTBuvNyJ00-qL-NUO7A,4.0,"Fresh juices and smoothies are one of my favorite things to eat. I make a smoothie at home almost daily for breakfast. When I'm on the go, in between meetings, I'm always thrilled to see a smoothie shop along theBway to refuel. Kwench is locally owned and so cute! Their juice menu pays homage to Tucson with fun names like Mount Lemmon, Bear Down and the wildcat. I ordered the Beast Mode Smoothie (Banana, kale, spinach, cacao, peanut butter and almond or coconut milk). I swapped the PB for almond butter and chose coconut milk. The smoothie was super sweet for my taste. It was a little jarring, considering it has kale. It could be that the  coConut milk was sweetened. But I didn't ask. If I'm in the area I might stop I just again and build my own smoothie.  In summary- Kwench offers an extensive juice and smoothie menu and merge option to build your own!"
5CLc6BHckNwfbbheWb3-hw,8j3oTBuvNyJ00-qL-NUO7A,4.0,I really wanted to like this place but I'm really astonished at the prices and the taste of it. This is my first time visiting and I got the kwench juice but it came with no ice so it was rather warm and my stomach was rather not happy so if you are wanting a cold refreshing retreat I would not go here as they don't seem to put ice in their juice drinks. And then got the wheat grass shot which was an astonishing four dollars if you go to Whole Foods you can get wheat grass for the same price which will give you more than one shot. You can also get juice with the same price at Whole Foods and it's cold. I also kind of thought they would have bottles or some kind of juice ready to go for you to get out of the fridge but that was not the case they do offer a juice cleanse or some sort but it's $44 which seems kind of steep for me when you could again go to the grocery store and get the same items that are again cold.

The place was sparkling clean behind the counter and at the customer tables and chairs. Service is prompt and employees are cheerful.

I can't wait to return and try more menu items - there are plenty of choices."

They have games you can play and music. Every one who works there is friendly and kind. We all started a conversation and had some good laughs. Now on to their products which are deeellliicioous!!! We watched as they grabbed fresh veggies and fruits to make our smoothies with. REAL VEGGIES AND FRUIT!!! In love!!! They also have a great selection of superfoods, juices, and bowls. And if you look in the little fridge they have by the cash register the energy bites are out of this world!! Absolutely will be going here for now on! To top if off they sell organic/locally made CBD products! Two thumbs up!!! They deserve more than five stars!"

There's always the same friendly faces here, I believe it's a husband/wife team! You feel immediately appreciated and cared for as soon as you walk in. I LOVE small businesses like this. You will always get asked before you leave if you like what you ordered. Also, they have alternative powdered protein! The pricing is totally competitive with Whole Foods and Nekter. Personally I think Smoothie King sucks, so I'm not even going to put them in the same category. You can also tell they use FRESH, real ingredients. I can't stay away from this place, lord help my wallet!!"

The fruits and veggies used are always fresh and delectable! I see they carry CBD products that are created by MD's. It all looks so amazingly out together. Great place. I suggest the Catalina bowl and the energy bites. They have very great tasting Energy bites. I go and purchase 2-3 containers of energy bites at a time 2 times a week.. I enjoy the ambiance, they're very attentive and so very friendly. They go above and beyond for the customer to make them happy. I give this place a 10/10! Such a great shop. We need one more centrally located. :)"

The acailicious bowl was tasty and filling, big portion size. I couldn't finish it all. Next time, I would add a few berries to the topping as I like my fruit on top not all mixed in. Friendly service. The juice menu looks amazing, we will be back next time we're in town!"

Also, how can you go wrong with a thirst quenching experience and a beautiful view of the mountains?! Cheers!!"

They know how to give good recommendations based on your preferences. They consistently make a delicious refreshing product with no added fillers or sherbets to dilute the juice/smoothie/bowl. It's so satisfying to know that everything there is actually healthy and fresh. Everything is priced reasonably, especially since you get such a high quality product. This is my regular go-to place for a smoothie, juice, or açaí bowl! Love it!!!"

I first visited it about 3 weeks ago, recommended it by my personal trainer, Christina from Prestige Fitness.  I had the joy of being cared for by Anthony.  He recommended what I was looking for and made it so delicious. I was impressed with the knowledgeable, caring and friendly way of Anthony.  My smoothies have been delicious, nourishing and well, perfect.  I have just today had dental work, not to have anything to eat as yet, but a smoothie which was perfect.  Anthony helped me again and I am more than pleased.  I love their location nearly on the corner of Ina and Oracle.  I without a doubt, am highly pleased and recommend this Kwench Cafe to all of you."

As I crossed the threshold all my senses were instantly peaked by the smell of the freshest produce and every cell in my body got excited about all the nutrients it was craving. 

Traveling for work I needed a super healthy dose of immune boosting, digestion friendly nutrients. I walked out with 3 fresh pressed juices all made to order and a smoothie. The owner used the most beautiful organic produce from beets, kale, ginger, lemmons carrots you name it. I even tried an amazing chai seed pudding that he said was a recipe of he and his wifes. I am so grateful for the friendly service and moreover the amazing  smoothie and cold pressed juices. No added sugar or artificial flavors even the almond butter used in my smoothie was made from scratch in house. They've got it right. Thank you."

KkI6e3aDI0_KhlwPoZw6ig,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Spendy.. maybe a bit too spendy for everyday eats.

But the fresh out of the oven pita, dry aged ribeye, and the fatteh were something special. Definitely give it a try!"
pdc3q-v8ZxB8Zm0K-TmiXw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"The food was absolutely amazing, which is enough reason to go back again and again.  

The Hummous was great, but the one starter we had was awesome; Fatar Meshwi (grilled wild mushrooms). I'm pretty sure I could eat that every day.  We also got two outstanding mains, the Kawarma (Lamb) and the Prawns.  My wife and basically fought to the death over each bite.  I can't say enough about the food, delicious.

Unfortunately there were a few negatives.  Not that it's a bad thing for everybody, but felt a bit too hip or New York for us.  But that's just a personal preference.  We're more salt of the earth Philly.  There was also the bar area, which we were told does not allow standing room.  They basically move you to an area to enjoy cocktails and the bar is only populate by those sitting there.  I like the idea of it, but the practice didn't hold.  My wife and I were sat at a two top along the path to the bar, and a large group was allowed to stand there and get after it during our entire meal.  We had someone's butt in our face throughout the meal.  I'm not sure why, but the rule seems to apply to some but not others, pretty frustrating.

All in all, the food heavily outweighs any of the negatives and I strongly recommend you give it a chance."
OC-CpkhmzWnI3jdk-rf0FQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Space / service / ambiance: 5/5

Food: 4/5

Solid spot but didn't quite live up to the reviews. Awesome restaurant - great for drinks, food or dates. However, the food here is above average rather than anything special to write home about."
3PyiC_pQm-OVnql2XO8XJA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I'm calling this place the ""La Colombe"" of hummus. Like LC, this place takes you on a culinary tour of Lebanon and Turkey. The flavors are beyond fresh and unique. They're totally in a league of their own! 

The menu is slightly overwhelming, so I defaulted to the original hummus and green salad. The original hummus is soft and nutty just like Zahav/Dizengoff (sorry to pull so many restaurants into this, but I think alluding to them shows the high standard of quality Suraya meets). I blame that on the tehina, Soom Foods. It is served with a pita, fresh from the oven, and it's soft and airy with a subtle crust. The green salad included gem lettuce, raw fennel, watermelon radishes, a soft-boiled egg, yogurt dressing, and pita chips. The flavor profile was satisfying. The meal overall was light, filling, and nourishing! 

I went back for seconds the week after. Opted for the baba ganoush, pita, and the rest of the party got the gravlax. Overall, everyone was satisfied. While the ganoush was tasty, I think I'll stick to the hummus. I appreciate that particular spread much more.  

Again, service and atmosphere were 10/10!"
2QgMYQezW00tbwTzYiuOtA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Yup, its gorgeous. This place is going to be the next darling of Fishtown. Tried a zatar labne flatbread and was really impressed with the texture. Had a pretty decent and certainly visually pleasing gingery cocktail. The place was already buzzing with people in its first week- when it opens with a full menu AND opens the courtyard, seats will be hard to come by."
qb5buJ0CfvfrmjF0TULkNg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,I've been a few times now.  I like their food.  So good to have a selection of places now serving manakeesh in the city. This place is pricey but the food is good quality.
pDovgf3tzlhCratVt7m3Sw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"The atmosphere and decor was very simple and beautiful, open and airy restaurant with a very nice outdoor setup. The food didn't take long, and the service was great. At one point we asked if we could get one of the wraps cut into several pieces and manager came to our table to suggest other options - we got a deconstructed beef kofta wrap and were able to make mini pitas ourselves.

True to Lebanese culture, everything is sharing-style plates. Ordered the Lahim bi ajin man'oushe, beet salad, lamb hummus, shish tawook, baba ghanoush, and beef kofta wrap. All were good, but compared to their other restaurant (Cafe la Maude) it fell a little short. And.. The bakery section was basically out of everything BUT we got the last rose and pistachio cruller and it was insanely good"
lZWSPVbB9TImEkamtpgS5A,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Walking into Suraya, you are instantly welcomed to a spacious environment filled with modern decor, grandiose lighting, open kitchen design that is bustling with energy. From the outside looking in you would never expect such a huge setting inside! You really feel like you've walked into a new city.

We were quickly seated for Sunday Brunch and was floored by how clean and new everything looked. From the tables to floors to ceilings and walls, everything looked immaculate.

Navigating through the Lebanese cuisine was a daunting, yet fun task. As we were perusing the menu trying to figure out what we were in the mood for, we kept our eyes peeled on the open kitchen to see what was coming out. This is definitely a place where it is strongly encouraged to share your plates.

We settled for a flatbread (manousche) that was very similar to a flat bread pizza, an order of lamb hummus with fresh pita, and a sharable plate also topped with pita. Our only regret was that we did not realize how carb-heavy the meal was, but nevertheless we dug in.

The food itself was very fresh. I am used to middle eastern cuisine, so the flavors itself were not very bold or aromatic, something I felt could have made the dishes stand out. Pitas came out piping fresh from the steel oven and the spreads were all made on the spot. I really enjoyed getting my hands into the food and tasting it. My only qualm was that I got bored of the flavors quickly (as-in it didn't make me want to go dig in for more) and after a while it was just a chore trying to finish the pita breads. I will definitely come back again to try out more things, definitely need to get more meat and vegetable options! The good thing is that it is very reasonably priced compared to other Fishtown alternatives."

dTmGjPbAsJiyl--eHLi9Ng,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"My friend and I had been wanting to try Suraya and were pleasantly surprised to score a reservation on a Saturday night. 

After checking in we did have to wait a few minutes for our table which was a small two top in the very back. The patio was closed but looked like an awesome place to dine. 

The best dish we had all night was the fatteh, a warm brown butter chickpea dip served with pita. The batata harra (crispy potatoes), fried kibbeh (ground beef dumplings), and turmeric rice were all delicious as well. 

I personally would not order the muhammara (red pepper and walnut dip) or the ground lamb kabob again. 

The kabobs were served with a side of charred tomatoes, onions, and peppers which were perfect on top of the rice. I wish I could make vegetables that taste that good at home. 

By the end of the meal we were both completely stuffed. I am anxious to come back and try brunch at Suraya, which I heard is their specialty!"
py3yhtqfuQcMMIkDh1shLQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"This place is great because it is the only (Lebanese?) restaurant on Frankfurt Ave. I don't like to walk that far from my apartment because I was born with an inherent laziness I have yet to learn how to shake, and this place is pretty ""in the thick of it"" in Fishtown. Suraya stops serving food at 330pm, which I cannot rationalize, as they have an enormous, dining-oriented space. I spent a good 15 minutes zoned out at my table mulling over their business model and how it doesn't financially pan out. 

The prices are high, but the food is pretty unique and includes fresh ingredients. Though when you order the ""Mezze plate"" be aware that is comes with a bowl of chopped vegetables that are secretly resting on ice cubes. I found it fascinating that while I drank my glass of red wine (+1 star for their liquor license), my small salad sunk into what I thought was maybe a pool of succulent middle eastern dressing, but was really just melted ice. Please note they charge an additional 1 dollar for chili oil, which my family found blasphemous. My father has, ""worked hard for a dollar every day of his damn life and will be f****** struck down by God's own light if he's going to spend that money on a tiny bowl of spicy indian oil."" Though archaic in delivery, I can see his point. When I suggested that maybe we should ""just go to Applebee's,"" my hipster brother pitched a fit and my dad responded with, ""Oh why don't you go spin your vinyl soundtrack of Dallas Buyers Club in your room;"" so here we are, silently eating foods we cannot pronounce.

Overall 7.5/10 experience, subtractions for the high prices and limited hours, additions for the liquor license and Counter Girl patience regarding my verbally unbridled PáPa."
7GmdH0AN1tCkvQjk0TXNiQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Great addition to the Philadelphia food scene. Will definitely be going back. 

Pros:
Food was delicious - some of the best Mediterranean food I've had in Philadelphia. Great variety. Everything is very light and the portions are appropriately sized.
Decor is fantastic, and to top it off they're working on opening up the patio in the future. 
Great little market with spices, chocolate, olive oil, and other specialty cooking items.  
Servers are very kind and attentive.

Cons:
We went for brunch on a Saturday so take this with a grain of salt but I feel that an established restaurant should be able to handle busy times, especially with such a large seating area. 
Made a reservation for 1:30 for 5 people. Didn't get seated until 1:55, which is fine except they said the kitchen closes at 2PM which made us very nervous/anxious. 
The 5 things we ordered came out at various times and we're pretty sure they completely forgot to make my friends sandwich until we asked where it was. 
They missed a couple things that the table ordered.  

Regardless, will definitely be back and highly recommend to everyone."

Waiters walk around in tan T-shirts that read Suraya, Yalla, or Habibi on them - super cute and was tempted to buy one for myself! Everything from the lighting to the decor and music felt very authentic. 

As for the food, the menu is super interesting. I was unfamiliar with many of the items on the menu, but quickly learned that you can't really go wrong with anything you order. We ordered the pastry basket to share - the cruller was my personal favorite! Then we ordered the baba ganoush, man'oushe with zatar, cheese and egg, sish taouk, and beet salad with falafel. Super tasty, creative presentation and great service! The hairblended drink coffee was also delicious with hints of citrus and dark chocolate. 

Excited to come back and check Suraya out for dinner sometime!"
DvhlhkaWdkL75dkfXdNe-w,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Food was generally good although I wasn't as blown away as I was hoping to be.

The mushrooms were delicious and meaty although some pieces were dried out from being over roasted.

The baba ganoush was quite good and the pomegranate was a nice touch. tbh didn't think it was that much better than my favorite takeout spot in NYC (Sahara's) but it was still good

The fatteh is delicious and rich and buttery, and you really do taste the brown butter. Probably horrible for you but it's so yummy.

Only gripe is that they don't do takeout for dinner since their kitchen is too busy."
JCyaOQpp_48fbGarWNii_A,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Their food is very tasty -- their desert yogurt is extraordinary.. The restaurant is both vegan-friendly and vegetarian-friendly. However, portions are small, the prices are a little high and they are quite busy. All in all, this would be a good place for a breakfast date or for meeting friends."
fMDwjmToOYt8kwPywJiINA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Great food and service. They sat us without a reservation with no fuss because space was available. The lamb was amazing, along all the other dishes we orders. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. The wine selection was good, my only qualm was the cocktails were not the same quality level as the food in my opinion. Will go again."

yKSxBozQ3pizBCQj5XAKJA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,First off the atmosphere is incredible! We did the chef tasting menu and it was nothing short of great! Lots of food and tried a few different dishes. Only reason it gets a 4 star is we had to chase down our waiter every time we needed drinks
eOybh0yNIeqziU1I9Q7vwQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"The food is what gives this place 4 stars. The mezze platter was really well done between the fresh pita, creamy and flavorful labne, cashew dukkah egg and additional items. 

We also ordered a green salad with falafel which was way too much food but also equally as good. In the future I'd opt for the beet salad without the mezze platter with a side of falafel or just the mezze with falafel. The green salad was somewhat bland compared to the beet salad and other flavors throughout the platter.

They serve stumptown coffee which is another plus but the downside is that it is $4 a cup. I love stumptown as much as the next coffee aficionado but $4 was steep without any offer of refills, which leads me to...

Service. Ugh, Suraya you were doing so well with the food and bright modern atmosphere but I can't understand the service. We ordered a beer which was no longer offered, decided to switch and get a mimosa which never arrived. Halfway through our lunch I was over the idea of a mid day mimosa but was then a bit surprised when the bill came and still had the beer on it. The server was pleasant and admitted to the mistake thus removing the beer from our tab but it made the flow of lunch so awkward--first anticipating beer, then a mimosa, then disappointment of having neither and then having to navigate removing it from our bill.

However, I'd return for sure! this could have been an off day service wise. Regardless of service, the food lived up to the hype that has been built up around this place and like others have said, blows zahav out of the water."
iOBGPNOkoCPdZh5_xKgtZw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Fancy but super expensive and made for hipsters. It's super made up with random odd hipster pairings which don't seem fully authentic in some dishes. I ordered some salmon flat bread pizza that was weird af. Wouldn't order again.

The hummus and babaganosh were delicious. Price is high though. You are paying for ambiance, so i wouldn't go here for cheap middle Eastern eats.

Chai tea with rose petals was nice. Grilled meats are nice also. Would go, but for a date or occasion not just to get middle Eastern food cravings"
Vgkk2R3sNc76DZ_Hsa0zLQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Super cute space with delicious food.  I have a few gripes which in the aggregate force me to subtract a star from the possible maximum.  I'll start by reiterating that everything I ate was delicious.  The vegetarian mixed appetizer thing was a rich, delicious smorgasbord of flavors - well balanced.  The ""middle-eastern ceviche"" (my words) was also great - very unique with a great blend of regional flavors.  The presentation was also lovely.  The food was a little pricey and the portions were small at first glance, but I decided the prices were reasonable because the food was, again, very rich and delicious.  Could use more vegetarian options.

The waitress suggested my party of two (fairly hungry) people order 2 mains and 2 appetizers, or more -- three appetizers was far more than enough, and she seemed miffed when we didn't order more.  I don't appreciate that.  The cocktails were ok; the drinks list overall was not impressive and was overpriced for the quality.

The shop area is super cute, but after browsing for holiday presents i didn't purchase anything because everything was . . . overpriced."
PsMSV5qNfx-kDVMTKCIggg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Cafe, brunch, lunch, dinner, bar area...can you ask for anymore? And outdoor garden with fire pits in making, which will open up in about 2 months. 
Food and service was amazing!!! Bartenders and the waiters are so well dressed, and the interior is super cute.

I came here to grab quick early dinner at 5pm, and we walked in without reservations and although lot of tables were empty, we were asked the grab a seat at the bar because they were completely booked for dinner. I totally didn't mind seating at the bar as were just there for quick bites and few drinks. Therefore, I recommend you make reservations for dinner.

We had hummus and pita, Muhammara and the Batata Harra and my favorite of it all was the Batata Harra. It's basically crispy fried potatoes with spices and it was absolutely delicious with full of flavors and spices. I just wish it came with some kind of dressing to dip it with but honestly you don't even need it. Hummus was delicious but nothing crazy as I have had better hummus in my life before but I'll try the crispy chickpea next time. Muhammara was something completely different that what I expected. When it arrived, I thought they sent me wrong stuff. It's mashed sweet peppers with seasonings and shaped into burger patty and topped with nuts and pomegranate. It was all right, and I probably wouldn't order it again. 

My boyfriend loved their cocktails and it's fun to sit at the bar and watch the bartenders make the drinks. I tried few different wines and I thought they were extremely weak, so next time I'll stick to the cocktails only. 

I'll definitely return back to try more of their Mezze and cocktails."
8KpFXdWiLVZFee_xan7AYw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"fresh authentic food! the hummus is prepared daily and you can tell, it was the best hummus i've ever had, along with the hot pita bread."

The food is really good. My only gripe is the portions. I understand there's a level of sophistication these places try to achieve with presentation. But honestly, they can do much better on portions for what you will be paying. Ambiance can't be beat though. You will love dining here for your first time."
J_pS8rmyOae63qsNRCExjw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"This establishment is beautiful - everything from the courtyard/garden area to the bar to the food itself is an experience I can't really compare with other restaurants. The cuisine takes a modern spin on traditional Middle Eastern spices (my husband corrects me and says it's specifically Lebanese, for those of you who will know the difference). We've been here twice and tried different foods each time, never disappointed. The service is excellent and our servers have always been a helpful and informative. 

My only gripe is that if you go from Thurs to Sat night, you will not get the frequent service you may get on other days. They're super busy. I strongly recommend making reservations at least a couple of days in advance (if it's a party of 1 or 2) and even more in advance if it's a larger amount. 

Our favorites were the Fatteh, which is a great combination of various temperatures, textures, and flavors, as well as the Muhammara, which is a unique spin on roasted red pepper with cumin. I would get both of these dishes again. 

Other good dishes were Baba Ganoush and Samke Nayyeh. The Samkeh Nayyeh is yellowtail with a potentially mint and tangy flavor (I could be simplifying it in a way that doesn't do it justice but it was good!)

The only thing I wouldn't get again is the Batata Harra - the written description and the waitress said it would be crispy but it came out completely opposite of crispy. The flavors were a little overpowering, not in a good way, and we didn't even finish this dish after the others had heightened our standards for the night!

All in all, Suraya is a wonderful restaurant that we'd recommend to anyone visiting Philly."
ZpXePpuNqEWzWDGbp8WFpg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Finally tried Suraya. Went for lunch on a weekday. The ambiance is out of this world. I love that they have a coffee bar/bake shop when you enter, a full bar and an open kitchen. The decor is amazing! I have tile floor envy! 

The food-it was good. Loved the hummus and the fresh baked pita. Ordered the beet salad and I knew it came with greens, but I wished it had more beets. It had lots of seeds, which I love, but I wasn't into the greens. They were too rough and tough for my liking. 

The service-good. Efficient. Not a lot of personality but they/we aren't there to make friends:)

I really want to try Suraya for dinner and drinks. I'm definitely getting the hummus."

We ordered the striped bass entree dinner. The food absolutely delicious with great flavor. I give the food 5 stars as everything we had was so good. The only reason I give it 4 stars overall is because the portions are a bit small for the prices. The food is top notch, but I wouldn't go overly hungry because you will leave hungry."
3EUFt0Ec8w6-MrLawcGQ5g,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,I really loved the environment. We had a couple of drinks only but will definitely recommend the patio there. I have heard about brunches and perfect meals at Suraya as well! Can't wait to get the chance to check out their brunch! Also it's said that people have to reserve their tables in advance as it gets too busy and won't be able to get a table if you just walk in!
jY7OFcSkZeklPdHuzGcMyg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,Great brunch spot or for any time of day. A bit pricey but tasty food. Can be very loud depending on when you go but worth it for the food and service. Will go back on an off hour. Also serves kombucha which I don't see a lot!

We had some flatbreads, a chicken platter and some lamb hummus- all excellent. The only reason I'm giving this a 4 star is because I felt like the quantity is not enough for the price.

Kebab seasoned very well but fish wasn't. As fish lover, I thought they could cook better than this. Other than fish all dishes are pretty well done. My opinion, they could give more volume. $23-28 per plate for main, two kebabs are not enough..maybe I am hungry for meat?!"
N3_NyH2Y_HHyjGr1UXfJeQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Food: 3.5
Service: 4
Ambiance: 4.5

The food is generally good, but not as creative or consistently interesting as similar spots like Zahav.  

 Food:

The best dish we had was the whole grilled dorade (samke harra).  The fish itself was moist AF, with a perfectly complimentary and interesting tomato-based sauce.  The skin, however, could be a touch crispier, and the dish could have been served with something else, like a starch or vegetable (besides parsley).

The samke nayyeh (raw yellowtail) is excellent, with the fresh yellowtail carried by just the right refreshing items, and a nice combination of the heat of the jalapeno with the cooling labne.

The baba ganoush is very good, with a just right smoky flavor.

The fatteh (chickpeas) was solid, with a nice contrast in flavors (and crisp). 

The fried kibbeh tastes like a cross between a familiar dumpling and falafel.

The sautéed chicken livers are fine if you like chicken livers, but it's sautéed, so it will not have the charring that can make livers and onions really shine.

The kibbeh nayyeh was odd, as the raw lamb and bulgur was pulverized to paste-like consistency.  It felt like eating an oily pate (or paste).  If you're one of the people who prefer your raw meat cut into discernible chunks, this is a hard pass.

The bread was just fine; it's very much a blank canvas.  But it was served to us barely warm (not piping hot), and cools down rapidly.

As for desserts, the tehina glacee was fantastic (if you like tehini), but the rhubarb and ashta had the over welcoming taste of eating jam or jelly with nothing quite interesting about it.

Service:

Very good.  The only complaint was a slightly longer than hoped for delay from the kitchen before our entrée, but otherwise no real faults.

Ambiance:

A lot of the crowd here is really trying hard to dress super cool.  So, you may feel under-dressed, or have fun seeing the crowd."
VHDX_aE3h2dwQUUCwwHyRw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"The decor is beautiful. I love how there is an outdoor seating area, indoor and then the more casual marketplace area for something quick rather than sit down service. 

The service was really good and everyone was very friendly. Our server gave us good recommendations. 

I got a flat bread that was delicious. It's also nice that it is a lighter meal so it won't weigh you down in warmer weather. I also tried the rose and pistachio cruller and was really excited about it, but, it was really greasy, like extremely greasy. It also tasted like the oil needed to be changed out in the fryer used to make the pastry. So that was disappointing. I also had a latte that was fine, nothing to get excited about though, which it should be since it's pretty expensive. My friend got the hummus, and loved it. Very fresh and the pita it came with was very good. 

Our bill at lunch was around $50 for a latte, plain black coffee, flatbread, hummus and cruller, which honestly seems to be pretty high for small plate type of food. 

I would possibly go again to try another flat bread and for the hummus. Overall I was not as thrilled with what I ordered as I expected to be and with all the rave reviews I've heard about this place. I do like how fresh the ingredients seems to be and that it is authentic food."
AOnVckhqSP2TsMNXS9nbEQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Came here for brunch just for the gravlax pizza and WERE OUT  Maybe we ordered the wrong things but was a little underwhelmed by the food. We had  the lamb hummus (great) Baba ghanoush (good but not the best we've had) and the manoush with cheese, long hits, Olive, onion and egg. It was good but just tasted like a regular flatbread.

On the way out I stopped at the cafe area in the front and grabbed a rose, lavender donut. This was the best donut I have ever had in my life. It tasted like a cronut, it was flaky and buttery and not too sweet. 

Overall it was good but I think the dinner food is better."

245aDNwyPbCh1ok-xZftPQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,Stopped by for brunch with a pretty large crowd. Place is busy so reservations are recommended. Tried a few items off the menu and the highlight for me was the baba ghanoush. It came with pomegranate seeds which complimented the dish perfectly. The chai latte was too pretty to drink - a bit on the too sweet side for me but overall pretty good. They have some fun selections for drinks including an apricot cardamom mimosa and a really great selection of pastries - the rose pistachio cruller is a must try!
3LY0bfs7T-LYl7e21aLCBQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I came here Sunday for dinner and had a wonderful experience... lives up to the hype. 

We started with the fatteh appetizer which was served with 2 pitas. It was delicious; we devoured it all - I wish it was a little larger. Next, my boyfriend and I both ordered the abu sayf kebabs. It's 3 small pieces of stripped bass and a grain/ onion underneath; very small portion for $27; would have been happier with a side dish. One of the pieces of my fish was slightly undercooked which made for a rubbery texture. The rest was flaky and amazing. We ate every last bite. We were still hungry so looked at the dessert menu- there are 3 dessert options. The one recommended was $15. Instead I ordered the chair tea latte (served with rose petals; amazing) and my boyfriend ordered the tehini hot chocolate which was good/ different. Overall, delicious food. Will definitely return. I really want to try the brunch!

Pros
- atmosphere is great/ unique
- wait staff is excellent/ friendly 
- our table was ready, we were seated right away 
- the food is delicious!!! 
- chai tea is amazing 

Cons:
- very pricey with small portions.
- could only have a 5:30 reservation Sunday but the restaurant wasn't busy at all around 6:30/7 (but it was easy to make a reservation; available that weekend!)"
xb8jWDBa0Jz4pf4A-rh2JQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"This is my favorite go-to brunch place in Philly. Never disappoints. Starting with the ease of making reservations. If you are not able to make one, get added on their notification list as their walk-ins have limited availability. Neighborhood is a bonus as well. If you come early, take a stroll around and enjoy Fishtown. Apricot flavored mimosas are a must try.
I took away 1 point for just a tad bit more sour taste than I would prefer. But again that s a personal preference:)"
QrjLLYcBs8E29hAKt6dCpA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"It's quite good, but I don't think it's the best restaurant in Philly. The service was lovely, which is all too tough to find any more. The pita is fairly thin; I like it thicker and I also prefer the hummous at Dizengoff. The fattouch was tasty (love sumac!) but the pita was so thin that when fried it was more like tortilla strips. The fried kibbeh were tasty, especially the spices and the yogurt beneath. We each had lamb for dinner. My husband's was the kawarma, which was the best thing we ate. I also enjoyed my chai latte to finish. One note is that if you don't eat meat or seafood, the mashawi (main dish) choices are nonexistent, although I'm sure they'd be happy to accommodate. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful although I wished the part we were seated in had had a bit more natural light. Overall, I'm left wondering if my expectations going in were simply too high."
U9EKBAXIgd1dHmXV_Z46oA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I would rate suraya as average to slightly above average in my opinion. It was hyped up by others and I can totally understand why...it's definitely tasty. However, I've been there twice now but don't rank it as my top new go-tos, but rather an average should try it once type of place. Vegetarian Menu is not as big as other Mediterranean restaurants I've been to and the meat skewers are not as moist and soft as preferred. But overall still tasty. Although One thing I definitely will rave about is their Lebanese chai l- delicious!"
woV5oA-qOsYBZRBllJJQKw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Let me start off by complimenting the stunning decor of the place. I felt like I was teleported to some sun kissed plaza in the middle of some Mediterranean cafe. 

The pastries here are LIT. We ordered the cruller and the jalouise which looks like a fancy pop tart. Cruller is a must have. The pop tart is kind of bland and dry. Maybe pop tarts TM have set the bar too high.

We ordered the hummus, chicken shish kabob plate, and the manoushe lahm bi Ajeem which is just a little pizza/thin flat crispy flat bread looking thing. 

Chrissy chickpea hummus was unique in flavor 

Chicken shish kabob plate comes with one chicken skewer. This comes with hummus so ordering a separate chick pea hummus was a little bit of a hummus overload 

The manoushe lahm bi Ajeem was okay. Skip the egg

The portions looked soooo small but we were still stuffed at the end. So happy ending overall. The pastries definitely helped to fill us up

Service was a bit slow but I didn't really mind since I was about to get dragged down to jewelers row

The crueler is a must have. Everything else was really pretty but tasted just okay. In the future I will be back for more pastries"
kQWaqtYdxGchGCe0kbxVeg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Finally getting around to this long-overdue Suraya review. A friend recently visited and jokingly said she wanted to see the most Instagrammable restaurant in Philly, and brunch at Suraya immediately leapt to mind. The cafe in the front, with its gold-toned chandelier lighting, is one of the most beautiful spaces I've ever seen, and the green-toned bar and intricate tiling in the main dining space creates such a lush, relaxing feel.

Beyond the beauty of the space, Suraya also delivers on the food. The hummus is silky, and the brown butter in the mushroom hummus adds some extra decadence. The man'oushe, which is like a pita pizza, is excellent, especially the cheese, tomato, and long hots one. (Heads up: the labneh one comes cold, which I was not expecting when I ordered it!) The pastries are very, very good - the cardamom kouign amann is the best rendition of that pastry that I've found in Philly, and the spiced coffee cake is excellent as well. I also love the Lebanese chai and the clementine ginger soda and am glad to see that they put just as much effort into the non-alcoholic selections as they do their alcoholic drinks menu. 

The food menu caters to all different diets and preferences, making Suraya the perfect spot to meet up with a group of friends. I do have to say, I like Suraya more for brunch/lunch; my dinner experience wasn't quite as good. Also, the service at the cafe counter was off the last two times I visited. I understand that those employees also make drinks for the restaurant space and are therefore rushed, but there's no need to be so rude - it was a jarring contrast to the friendly servers in the main dining area, and unfortunately the last impression my out-of-town friend encountered when she wanted to buy another kouign amann for the road.

Tip: Suraya has free parking in the back! I feel like people don't really know about it - we only found it because we had to circle the block for parking."
KycEhWn6oPwv5vslddKDDA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Tried the hummous, fried kibbeh, and fatteh to start. All of which were great, but the fatteh was something else entirely. It was simply amazing. The entree didn't disappoint either. Had the halabi kebab and it was cooked to perfection, easily some of the best lamb i've ever had, placing Suraya among my top favorite restaurants.

The only downside was the service. Our server was no where to be found and our entrees took about 30-40 minutes to arrive. She seemed like she could only focus on one table within her section at a time, ignoring the rest. For example, when asking if the table adjacent to us wanted more to drink, she got their order and didn't even bother to glance at our table to see if we needed anything. Coming from a serving background, it'd be more efficient to at least scan your entire section to avoid multiple trips later on. Maybe i'm being nit-picky, but I expected higher quality service in comparison to the level of food being served."
8XV8kQzNEbNshAuG7eWyHQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Suraya is definitely a great addition to Frankford Ave. The interior decor is very pretty. I love the open layout, brightness, and the fact that you can see all of the delicious pastries at the counter as soon as you go in. (If you've ever been to Manakeesh in West Philly, this place is kind of a fancier version of that, but with table service and different offerings.) 

Michael F and I stopped by for brunch. Service was very friendly, attentive, and warm from beginning to end. One thing I'll point out though is that the host stand's location farther into the restaurant can be a bit confusing to newcomers - makes it unclear whether this is a ""seat yourself and order at the counter"" sort of place, or if it's a table service kind of place. However, someone directed us to the host stand when we came in and we were seated at a bright table by the window. 

Food-wise, they have a decent selection largely divided into the categories of flatbreads, salads, brunch plates, sandwiches, hummus, and pastries. We ordered a kebab plate ($21) which came with one kofta kebab, tabouleh, hummus, pita, and seasoned fries, as well as a man'oushe (flatbread) with za'atar, onions, and tomatoes. We also ordered a bloody mary, Lebanese chai latte, and a cruller (choux pastry doughnut). 

Overall, I felt the food was tasty, but a bit under-seasoned and over-priced for what it is. My favorite items were the cruller and lebanese chai latte, yet they were both $5-$5.50 apiece... I am used to paying $4 for a very good doughnut or a nice hot beverage in NYC, but I was a bit surprised to see prices higher than NYC in Philly, especially at a place where I would be paying tip on top of the listed price. I'm definitely glad I stopped by and will likely come back for pastry/hot drinks, but I could probably find a more substantial meal for the same price somewhere else in the neighborhood."
Hduvtc_idzMckRfd_X9R4A,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Lots of pros and a few cons. I didn't sample enough of the menu to really assess the food but what I had was tasty though portions were minuscule. The restaurant is spacious and attractive and there is a heated outdoor garden that is lovely where one can take appetizers and drinks (but not the full menu). That space is quiet and restful unlike the main space, which is noisy and boisterous.

So pro is crowd-pleasing Lebanese food and lovely outdoor space, cons are no full service in the quiet garden, high prices, noise, and small portions."
0jt9IyOYzbWSnR8cL49L9w,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Suraya is so hot right now that I seemingly can't go more than a few days without seeing a friend or two post on their Instagram story flashes of the Lebanese dishes. It's a shame that the lighting is not conducive to good photos though.  

It's so hot right now that, just a few days out, I was barely able to get a reservation for a Thursday night. 

I've been to Suraya twice now, once for brunch and once for dinner. 

Suraya is beautiful, first off. It's a gorgeous and huge restaurant space with woods, tiles, plants (it's 2019!), a big open kitchen, and even back terrace. So it totally wins on atmosphere. 

Let's talk food. I've been solidly impressed with everything I've tried here, but there's been only one truly stand out item--one that made me giddy for just how good it was--and that was the rose and pistachio cruller at brunch. 

For my brunch, I mostly shared a few pastries and tried the chicken shish taouk, which is basically a chicken shawarma wrap with fries on the side. 

Those pastries are incredible. Honestly, they were my favorite things. The rose and pistachio cruller is fried to order and arrives freshly hot at your table. From the leftover heat that radiates out of the beautifully formed cruller, the rose aromatics hit your nose first even as you just marvel at how gorgeous it is. Then you go in and there's a slight, slight crispness to the exterior. Inside, it's warm, somehow airy but also custardy interior, perfectly moist (I'm SO sorry to use that word). 

That cruller will haunt me every day I don't have it. 

I'll also absolutely recommend the kouign amman, which is basically a croissant dough with lots of caramelized sugar. These were nowhere a few years ago other than specialty bakeries and I guess France, but now you're seeing them all over the place, including Starbucks. 

This one at Suraya is better than all the others though. Yes, it is! Why? It's not JUST butter, flour, and sugar. There's also hint of chai spices. Brilliantly, all the beautiful textures of the kouign amman are there, perfectly executed--perfectly crunchy caramelized sugar and buttery-doughy insides--and then you ALSO get this underlying warmth and spice from the chai. It's a brilliant pastry. 

So there I've done what I set out to do with this review and rave about the pastries. On to other matters. 

For the main event of my brunch, I gave the shish taouk a try. This is a wrap with yogurt-marinated chicken and fries. Honestly, I thought it was good, but it wasn't nearly worth $16 in my mind. And unless you're ordering a bunch of mezze type dishes, if you want a single brunch entree, Suraya doesn't have an expansive brunch menu. 

So when it comes to brunch, I'd recommend going with a big group and sharing all the smaller dishes, and of course a basket of pastries. 

When it comes to dinner, the menu is much bigger and has a wealth of options. Even though I did not get this, I would recommend getting the ""Taste of Suraya"" prix fixe option. You have the options of many different little dishes to try and an entree and a dessert for $60. 

I opted just for the kawarma: a baharat-rubbed roasted lamb, with a cucumber and pomegranate salad. The lamb was perfectly cooked and had remarkable flavor. It was slightly charred in the way that you want roasted meat to be, and it was rich, with just enough fat, and a pretty laid back spice profile. On the side is also a small dollop of dill yogurt that I would tell the chef could be five times as large and THEN we're talking. 

The portion sizes of entrees might underwhelm at first sight, but again once you take into account some of the other dishes and maybe a dessert, you're definitely not leaving hungry. 

I also tried a few bites of other peoples' dishes, like the fried kibbeh (seemed good!), the kafta kebab (very good!), and the saffron rice (also good!). 

Finally, dinner ended with a tehina and carob mousse glacee. This was a delicious dish but was not what I was expecting from the mousse in the name. I was expecting a very light, airy, rich kind of fluffy something. The dessert is actually a less-than-hockey-puck-sized disc of a crunchy caramel bottom, a ""mousse"" that's much more like a custard, and topped with a caramel. Honestly, far from being a mousse, it was more dense than a New York style cheesecake. Which is not inherently bad! But just not what I was expecting. That said, it was a delicious dessert. In fact, though the dessert menu is small, I would have loved to try all of the offerings. 

So, overall I really like Suraya a lot and totally recommend it as one of Philly's best offerings at the moment."
cmd8GEGyvs2ur7bGkx02Xw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Suraya was a great experience and definitely worth a trip. I have dined there a few times and enjoyed it each time. The prices are reasonable given the hype of the restaurant they can afford to upcharge some things and people don't seem to mind. Don't get me wrong the food is good but I think the prices you pay are more due to the hype around Philly's newest gem. 

Again, worth it - and the portions are a pretty good size.

We started with the hummus and the pita, both of which certainly met expectations and we're delicious. I had the chicken as my main and my husband had the lamb. The chicken was probably one of the best roasted chicken dishes I have every had and it came served on a bed of potatoes that were so perfectly seasoned. I got a side of rice which ended up being too much food but it was also very good and worth it as well. 

The reason it's 4 and not 5 is mostly because of the service - it was not up to par for a restaurant of this calibar in my opinion. We were made to wait quite some time for our seats and service was quite spotty.

All in all a great experience and definitely recommend you go!"

Skip the main course. Trust me. Portion sizes tiny. 
Slightly overhyped but worth coming once."
CSq3ljv-PrVS7GgSbiUFVA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"My first time here at Suraya was awesome. I came for HH with my friends and we were seated in their beautiful outdoor garden area. I fell in love as soon as I walked through the back white French doors. 

You walk out to beautiful stone walk ways, comfy sofas, small cute French style tables, and a little bit of greenery throughout. There is a smaller bar in the middle and on the other side a little fountain for your perfect Instagram photo op. The entire outdoor area is so beautiful you really have to go see it for yourself. 

HH is from 5:00-6:30pm. Not the longest time, but the food and drink prices are reasonable. You can easily come for HH, but stay for dinner. Make sure if you do want to have dinner here make your reservation early in the week as they book up fast. 

Only complaint was the inattentive service in the back. Though we were offered water as soon as we sat down, it took a minute before our drinks came, the follow up after our food was served was a long stretch of time, and we weren't given silverware until we had to ask for it. It's a little lacking, but nothing that would rise to the level of me not to come back. I do wish to come back and try their dinner menu."
A2jlnn68hHjfbG6j0Qw3qw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"It took a long time to get a reservation here, and it was worth the wait! Super cool ambiance and decor. Love the little marketplace up front! The drink menu is so creative and the presentation is gorgeous. We got the chef's tasting menu and enjoyed hummus, baba ganoush, labne, tabouli - all done so well and very fresh. The pita was so puffy and light, we couldn't get enough! The guys had the ribeye steak and the girls went for the swordfish kebabs. Everything was so flavorful it was ridiculous. Can't wait to go back again!"
_lcCtUEIbiX2sW2WVRfkPQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"What we ate:
A Taste of Suraya which consisted of:
Hummous, Baba Ganoush,
Muhammara, Labne,
Taboulé,  and 
our choice of two additional which included:
Arnabeet Mekle
Batata Harra
baharat rubbed lamb
Prawns
Plus dessert
Coffee & Chocolate Verrine
Raspberry Sorbet

Reservations are an absolute must.  We arrived for our 5 p.m. reservation to find the restaurant extremely crowded.  Parking was difficult but we did manage to find free street parking a few blocks away.  Be prepared to drive around a few times to find an open spot.   We waited about ten minutes before actually being seated.  There is a nice display area upon entering.  
We were seated in what appeared to be a nice private area with a view of the kitchen.  Some of the dishes were excellent.  We especially enjoyed the hummous, baba ganoush, cauliflower, potatoes and prawns.  We also had some that we did not much are for such as the rubbed lamb which was covered in way too much dill.  Our server was very nice but appeared to have too many tables to properly see to each person's requests.  She was very careful to adhere to my friend's glutton diet.  However, we were surprised to be charged for cucumbers when my friend was unable to eat pita bread.  We ended meal with dessert and coffee."
koXIGZKZIZxWQTrsKMqlzA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I've been here a few times, for brunch and dinner. I like the pastry items in the front cafe area, very tasty. I forget now exactly what I had, but we tried a few and they were all good.

Came here more recently for dinner. I arrived before my friends, so I had a drink at the bar. The bartender was good enough to tell me they had happy hour at the bar, so I ordered the happy hour Manhattan, which was quite good, not too sweet. The hostess let me know when my friends arrived. It took a while to close out my tab at the bar, but another bar tender noticed I'd been waiting and got to it. The hostess then led me over to my friends - I think this is a policy they have to make guests feel like they are being taken care of, but it was a bit funny because I could see where my friends were and was perfectly able to find them on my own. The waitress also spoke in a way that it seemed the waitstaff had been told to speak - ""what can I complement your table with?"" - no issue with that, it was just noticeable and didn't come across as natural.

On to the food: we split a bunch of the small plates. The hummus was good but not the best I've had. The bread was tasty. The baba ganoush has a good texture, velvety. The fatteh was really good and flavorful. The fried kibbeh was pretty good but perhaps a little strong on the cinnamon. 

My second drink was the The Nightingale because I wanted to try the arak - good but a bit much in terms of flavor and sweetness. A half portion would've been enough.

And for dessert we split two items. I forget what they were called, but one had shaved ice and beets which was interesting and pretty good. The other was something with banana and chocolate - very rich and tasty."
Ke5GKv_oJ5OZ4gB1qkU7yA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, but I'll round up for the excellent and attentive service .

We got the tasting menu, and the first course ""Mezza"" was terrific.  Everything was very fresh, exotic, and reinforced the #1 Philly restaurant rating.

The main course, however, was very disappointing, both in taste and in size.  The swordfish consisted of 2 small chunks of dry fish, with overwhelming amount of vegetables to make up for the absence of the protein.  The lamb kebab was unappetizing with way generous amount of spices that just overwhelm your palette.

Dessert was creative but definitely on the over sweet side for our preference.

Overall, not ""shuraya"" will be coming back"
VLmqv8SXxavensFriacN_w,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Solid Lebanese food in a beautiful restaurant, from the foyer to the main dining room to the outdoor area. Definitely great for any occasion, casual or upscale. We ordered one meat, one seafood, and three mezzas and that was perfect for two people. The beef kebab was super flavorful (the herbs came through strongly) and the tang from the lemon and garlic complimented the Caledonia prawns wonderfully. Although all were good, my favorite from the mezzas was probably the grilled mushrooms (fatar meshwi) that came on a bed of tangy yogurt sauce.

If you're feeling extra hungry, the ""Taste of Suraya"" set menu looks great! It's $58 a person and comes with a lot of food."
G7mocnCJKVQeg2bHokbXmA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Suraya is really good, but I honestly think it's overpriced for what it is. The hummus is delicious! I could bathe in it."

The service was welcoming and generous.  We started with hummus, a red pepper appetizer, and their special salad of cucumbers and tomatoes all served with delicious puffed up pita.  Both our friends and we ordered fish.  The bass was delicious but the portion was small . Our friends ordered the sword fish and also thought the portion was small. That said, we were very satisfied as we ordered a lot!  

AND they were wonderful about bringing our friends a dessert to celebrate their anniversary.  

WE WILL be back!!!"

The food itself was pretty good. We got a plate with eggplant, some kebab chicken, hummus, and bread pizza. The bread pizza was really good, was perfectly flavored. The eggplant plate with pita was okay. The eggplant thing was a little similar to hummus, but it was a little bitter. The pita was baked to a really puffy shape and was delicious though. The chicken was okay. The salad and fries that came with the kebab plate were surprisingly good tho. 

This is a pretty good place to bring guests to when they visit Philly for brunch!"

The food was just good, though (although I started adding tahine to my hot chocolate after having my mind blown by their hot chocolate here). I was impressed by the quantity of food so it's a good value, but I guess I'm not seeing why it's a destination restaurant. Maybe it would be different if it were warm and the back garden was open?"
YpShHrUpI2ddC_Px3LTcTA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Whoa! What an amazing place! If you are tired or envious of seeing your friends posting pictures of their Mediterranean vacations and seek to experience something similar, head to Suraya.
As soon as you enter you are transported to an exotic place, open kitchen space and a garden with fountains. 
While waiting for your table to be set up, you can spend time getting a drink or 2. 
We were early for our reservation so spent 30-45 minutes in the moonlit garden drinking and taking in the scenery. 
Once seated we were explained about the menu and we decided to get the hummus and batata Harra. For entrees I chose the lamb kebab and my SO got the kawarma, with a side of turmeric rice and long hots. 
Before I get into the details, I must admit, being born and brought up in the Middle East I am highly critical of the food. The hummus was unremarkable, the pita bread was okay. Zahav still holds its position! 
The batata Haraa was good but I've had better (au'zaatar, NYC). 
The lamb kebabs and kawarma were really savory, but zahav definitely beats it again! 
Suraya is a superb place for date night, or to take your bougie friends from the city!"

+ chai lattes (this is nicely foamy but still thick and topped with rose petals that give a unique floral flavor to counterbalance the richness of the milk. Not as spicy as other chais I've had - I would have liked to have seen a bit more spice)

+ lahm bi-ajeen (this is like a flatbread pizza topped with beef. The chives smelled so rich and fresh, and  the lemon topping was a nice touch!)

+ mushroom hummus (loved this! Usually not a huge mushroom fan but definitely recommend ordering this)

+ fries (they come with a garlic aioli and some hot sauce and these were thick cut but also crisp!)

We loved everything that we ordered! The menu seems a bit limited, but I'd be interested in coming back to try out dinner."
jFFJWsex9z5l7n6BD9LKgg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Snagged a Thursday 5:45 dinner reservation at the kitchen counter with a foodie friend visiting from out of town a few weeks ago. We opted for the tasting menu, which seems like the obvious move for a first visit and well worth its price. The portions were pretty small, but because there were so many plates, we found ourselves quite full by the time dessert rolled around. Dessert itself was surprisingly good; I rarely go into dinner thinking ahead to dessert, but it turned out to be one of the more memorable courses of the evening.

I do think Suraya is ever so slightly overhyped. The restaurant is beautiful, the service is excellent, and the food is terrific -- but nothing stood out to me as head and shoulders above everything else I've ever had in Philadelphia. It's not a place I'd go extremely far out of my way for, but if I come by another convenient opportunity, I'd certainly look forward to eating there again."
gANBty58PW4PkQuG5cztxw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Suraya is such a beautiful restaurant, both inside and outside! Even the cafe area in the front is beautiful I love it.

My friends and I came here for dinner and we were seated outside in the garden at the communal table. It's such a beautiful place to eat at with the bar and the water fountain around you. 

My friends and I ordered the hummus, baba ganoush, fatteh, and the samke nayyeh for our starters. The hummus was not out of this world. It was good but not anything I would come back for. 
The baba ganoush was really good and well done and the fatteh was just amazing. This was my favorite dish that night and was recommended to us by the waiter. It's a hot dish that comes with warm chickpeas, eggplants, cripsy pita, tehina yogurt, topped with almonds and cashews and some green onions. It's so good I would definitely recommend this for a hot dish.
The samke nayyeh was also recommended to us by the waiter. He said it was great if you like sushi or sashimi so we got it to try. I wasn't blown away by it. The flavors are great but the fish didn't taste very fresh to me. 

For our dinner, we decided to share the kafta kebab and the abu sayf. The Kafta kebab is a beef kebab that is seasoned with a bunch of herbs and comes with charred onion, tomatoes and peppers. The abu sayf was also recommended to us by the waiter - it's grilled swordfish marinated yogurt, lemon, garlic and more. It was really well done and was pretty good too. 

I wasn't blown away by the dinner entrees we chose and definitely enjoyed our starters more. The flavors are great though and I will probably be coming back for more of the fatteh and baba ganoush. 

All in all, this is a beautiful place to catch up and grab dinner with friends and family. The ambiance is very very nice and it's just a beautiful place to eat at. The food is good and the staff is very nice!"

IaqiMV-AxhhA3XMG5C-IPw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Enjoyed brunch very much. I regret not getting the pastry basket. The two we did order (coffee cake & kouign amann) were both very good.

The portions are very generous. For the price, I was expecting my flatbread to be the size of a business envelope. Nope! 12 inch diameter pizza size. For $10. And damn good too.

Other guests shared the Lebanese omelette, which was reportedly ""fine"" and ""good"" respectively.

Brunch cocktails were perfect for a summer day. Bloody Mary was tasty but not overly spiced or spicy. Mimosas was your standard fare. Gin Fizz was excellent.

Service was good in spite of the place being very full. Sound wasn't an issue but the place was definitely ""bustling""

One gripe was the presence of a number of house flies buzzing around. It's not an open air venue. Or at least it wasn't that day since the doors & windows were all shut to keep the AC in (it was 100+ outside). If I'm seeing flies in the dining room, what's it like in the kitchen?"
DdM9bnZNGdB6-ZtmEEtwuw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"My reference point for this type of cuisine is Zahav, (I know one is Lebanese and one is food of the Levant but they have many similarities) so with that in mind I had high expectations. The ambiance of Suraya is pretty cool. Its deceptively large inside with warm low lighting which is romantic and relaxing. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated despite our reservation which was not a big deal except that there is no seating in the waiting area so we were kind of hovering over other diners. When we were seated our server was quite excellent and informed us of all the most popular menu items. We tried hummus to start, it was ok, but it really did not measure up to the hype surrounding this restaurant especially when there are two restaurants 10 minutes south (Dizengoff and Zahav) that serve world class hummus. Where Suraya shined was the main course. I had the kofta kebab and my girlfriend had the lamb. They were delightfully flavorful and cooked to perfection. I would most certainly come back to try that again. It's expensive, probably more so than Zahav but the service was excellent and most of the food was great. It still can't knock off Zahav as the top place for high end middle eastern fare in my book, but it's a close second."

The place itself is really chic and cute. The decor and dinnerware all went together really well - thoughtful design on the owners part. We all sat and admired our cute mugs before we got some coffee in them.

In terms of the food, everything we had was pretty good. The pastry basket I think is a must for the table. We cut each item into small pieces to try each one so maybe two baskets would be needed next time. I had the beet salad (really fresh and a lot of aromatic flavors) with the kafta kebab addition (wasn't the best I've had but still good). The za'atar man'oushe with an egg and the kafta kebab sandwich both looked really good but unfortunately I didn't get a taste of either. 

Overall had a really enjoyable time with good food and good ambiance. Next time will have to try their dinner menu!"

DztYrIGwcZJ2039xKUgLjQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Suraya gets SO many things right - the atmosphere and food are STUNNING - that a few minor things that weren't quite right have really stuck with me. 

The bad first: 
* Service was spotty. Had to practically beg to have my water glass filled on numerous occasions. Had two servers almost run into me on my way back from the restroom. 
(... but when I couldn't decide on a glass of wine I was offered a taste of one I was considering - very thoughtful!)

* Cost. Yikes. I did not anticipate this being a $110/person (2 of us) dinner. And it easily could have been MORE if we had bought a bottle of wine (the most inexpensive bottle on the menu was $65+? glasses - 3 oz pours - were $12.50+?).  

Now, the good: 
* The food is seriously amazing. We had the fatteh and lamb sausages (makanek) to start. Both were DELICIOUS, and the fresh pita was incredible. Could have used a larger portion of the fatteh. We shared the kawarma and halibut, both of which were outstanding! And the dessert... kanafeh... yum. I'm not usually interested, but this was worth every bite. 

* And the atmosphere is perfect - darker, spacious, so comfortable and interesting! Definitely a great location for a romantic or family dinner. 

Wish I could afford to go more often - curious about brunch!"

Sat at the bar and sipped on an apricot mimosa while waiting for my lunch. Being a huge hummus fan, naturally I order the hummus with lamb. That bad boy came out looking like a snack (literally)! The lamb was so crispy and the hummus was so creamy it was a delicious marriage of textures. I must have looked like a fool scraping the sides of the bowl with the pita and then shoveling it my mouth. Oh, well...

7WaNM0KpDynAr6Om55aRtg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"We really liked our food at Suraya but the service and prices left something to be desired. We had to wait approximately 15 minutes after our reservation time to sit which we were fine with (we were a couple minutes late ourselves).  We had a cocktail and the back waiting area which was nice but slightly awkward (in location and feel).  Once we were sat, both our waitress and then the manager came over to apologize for the delay. This was appreciated and was heartfelt. The manager ""rounded out"" our meal and included two dishes on the house - which was nice. The manager worked his way around to most tables throughout the evening which was a nice touch. 

If that had been the extent of our delays, I would have had no issues. However, after a quick delivery of our first round of plates, there was a delay in our second round, and then a very extended delay (30 minutes) from our our second round until our main course arrived. This delay was magnified by the fact that our waitress seemed to have disappeared at this point to take care of additional drink orders and water refills. Furthermore, we learned of the specials at this point in our meal from listening to another waitress describe them to another table. We were never informed of any specials. Overall, the service needs a boost despite the work of the manager. 

The second issue I had were the prices - especially with the mezza. All of the dishes seemed to be 1 or 2 dollars overpriced - even for a nicer setting. It also seemed odd that they tacked 50 cents on to the price of so many items.  The price for the mashawi was a slightly better price point but the amount of food that came with it (at least the abu sayf) was a noticeably small portion. The prices seem to exceed Zahav (I know they are different cuisines but same environment and similar costs). Additionally, I don't think there was a bottle of wine below $60. 

Overall, food was very good but some issues. Highly recommend the fatteh, muhammara, and abu sayf."

We will definitely be returning!"

I was comforted by the fact that they were able to modify many dishes since I have allergies. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away by any of the dishes.  My favorite was the Fatteh - filling and flavorful. Nothing else super memorable. The hummus and pita wasn't as good as Zahav's. Get dessert! We loved the Kanafeh - a cheesy dish that is pleasantly sweet. The apples and ashta was also superb. Overall a fun experience.

The restaurant gestures to ideas of a bazaar combined with Levantine palace and garden. The interior is rich in colors and doors of spices and coffee waft from the kitchen and market. Having been there only for brunch I can vouch that it's an ideal spot for a birthday brunch, bridal shower, or twosome dining spot. We sampled the famed pastry basket which was more than enough for 4-5 people to sample a bit of each with some leftover. Everything was delicately flavored and unique. For brunch most of us tried the various salads with meats added. Everything was fresh and adequately flavored. Going back I would recommended sampling some of the many shared dips which many tables around us were laden with. I'll definitely be back!"
dLIBnDk31qVbQcCqrlbrxg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I stopped by on a Monday for an impromptu lunch date and was seated promptly. 

Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about sharing her favorite menu items.

We ordered a coffee and Lebanese Chai Tea, which I have been seeing all over Instagram. The foamy goodness was served in the most ornate cup and topped with edible flowers.

We started with the MUSHROOM HUMMOUS, 
with pine nuts and brown butter, which was pleasantly more tasty than I would have expected it to be.

For lunch we ordered 2 different Man'oushe, Lebanese flatbreads.  CHEESE, TOMATO, 
ONION, LONG HOT, PARSLEY (simple and flavorfull) and the ZA'ATAR, LABNE, OLIVE, CUCUMBER, TOMATO, MINT(This one was presented more like a wrap and had too many I think sesame seeds for my liking)

Overall a great experience, hope to come back soon to try more of a variety of menu options."
X8JZ3wHZCW3MENZYEnIjUg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Loved this place for the apps and the drinks! The rest of my party liked their main dishes but not as much as the apps. I absolutely LOVED the mixed salad. Like seriously, I think about it sometimes. I'm not sure if they have a happy hour, but if they do then I am definitely returning! Our waiter was really nice but it was disappointing my salad came out maybe 30min after everyone's food. But I would still go back for that salad. Oh and some mushroom dish that was vegan - that was great too!"
Bs6XXciiUVJZ2QTr6V-KYQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I went for dinner with another couple and unfortunately, we didn't feel like it lived up to the hype.

The decor is really trendy and nice. It's actually a much bigger restaurant than I expected. However, the food is only OK and the small plates and high prices didn't really win me over. I have heard the brunch is really good, so I may go back and give it a second chance."
vg5Mwa919u-KnVwsVyhXWw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"So it's a pretty pricey place, turned out to be $30 ish per person for brunch. The place though, is absolutely beautiful. It looks small from the outside but is so spacious on the inside. 

I got a Lebanese chai latte, my friend got the drip coffee. We split a bread basket and a kabab plate. The bread basket had a variation of their best pastries (olive oil cake, chocolate almond financier, kouign aman, seven spice  coffee cake, rose pistachio donut).  Everything was super amazing, but we definitely couldn't eat all of it. 

The kabab plate comes with hummus, spiced fries with aioli, tabouleh, choice of meat - we got chicken, and one pita. 

Service was great and very attentive. I'll definitely come back!"
k9e0unCJx9B_LuccMFLn7w,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"There is so much to love at Fishtown's fav Suraya.  

1. Ambiance.  The size of the place, inside and out, is HUGE for Philadelphia, and it's beautifully decorated. I didn't realize we had big, gorgeous, airy restaurants in PHL!  I am used to skinny BYOs, which I have never minded. 

2. Service. The best word to use here is polished.  Our waiter was kind and funny, yet attentive and professional.  And it's a team environment...we had positive interactions with at least three other servers.

3. Food.  Our favorite course was mezze.  We sampled many dips, as we chose the tasting menu.  The eggplant in the baba ganoush was smooth and smoky; hummus was silky, and the muhammara offered a vibrant pop of red pepper, walnut, and chile flavor.  The crispy potatoes were also delicious...both savory and spicy at the same time.  And don't get me started on the bread...baked from scratch and mangnifique.  Eat lots and lots of it.  Main course and dessert were less exciting...the chicken was actually quite salty (I am still drinking water as I write this).  We had the banana and apple desserts: the apples and olive oil cake were delicious, but the tahini curd on top was off-putting, and while the banana ice cream and whipped topping were delicious, the candied beets were not sweet tasting and overpowered the other flavors.

I'll leave you with a pro tip; though the tasting menu is a good value, it's just too much food.  You'd be better off getting 2-3 mezze, one entree, and skipping dessert.  

Overall, best restaurant in Philly?  No, I think the best of Philadelphia lists overhype it.  Delicious Lebanese style food with some lowlights, yes."
6Cl6gEHLqUQOJITAPSIuRg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"The ambience in here is classy, cozy and a good place to have a conversation with your company since the noise level isn't unbearable.  The baba ganoush and the chateau kefraya. The arak was a first for me. But i like anisette so this I didn't mind trying. It met the full flavor and smooth test . My bartender was really nice and gave me a little lesson on the arak. I'm going to try the branzino. Let's see how this will taste. Wait for part two of my review."
NfjwhyqMdybkRxPhyqAjoA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Having been to Suraya when it first opened and seeing it now, you can notice how this popular restaurant continues to evolve.  The critical and popular acclaim have been very positive for this Lebanese restaurant in Fishtown and it frequently is listed among the top eateries of Philly. In many ways it deserves all this applause.  It is an attractive place with five distinct eating & drinking areas - a café, a bar, a dining room, a cute rear dining space, and a large outdoor garden café. As soon as you step into Suraya there's a buzz and it's a buzz in a nice way as despite the crowds, you can still hear your dining partner.

The menu is large and I have tried so little but what I have tried is good but not outstanding.  At a recent lunch here I ordered one of their man'ouches (flatbreads) topped with Kishik, tomato, and onion (although I didn't see or taste the onion).  I'm going to be honest, Manakeesh in West Philly serves up a much tastier man'ouche than the one I was served at Suraya which just didn't have a lot of flavor or substance. The cashew Dukkah egg on the other hand was perfectly done and full of flavor. My waiter was excellent - water was refilled twice without asking and he checked in to see if I needed anything else.

Now a couple of notes: 

An egg is one of the few things I eat with salt.  Asking for salt here is a big production as they have to go to the open kitchen and put an order in for it (I actually watched my waiter) and about 5 minutes later someone else will deliver a small open container of salt to you.  That to me is a little silly.

Second note - I reserved via Open Table and even mentioned that fact when I checked in on time.  During the meal, I got an email from Open Table that the restaurant had reported me as a no-show. Open Table added a lecture paragraph on the importance of honoring reservations to me.  I showed this to the two people working at the host stand on the way out. One of them had clicked me as a no-show to Open Table but both claimed they didn't and didn't know why they had not checked me in.  I contacted Open Table and they did get it corrected.  Suraya needs a system to insure people are checked in when they reserve through Open Table."
-8zJ1Sa5iRguHkUoLbKgqQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"A few months ago, we made reservations for Suraya (rated the #1 restaurant in Philadelphia for 2019 and was declared the best NEW restaurant in 2018). We were quickly seated at our table and didn't have to wait at all. We tried to go a few months earlier but happened to stop by in between their brunch and dinner service so limited food was available for purchase. The Market side is more quick-service with salads, sandwiches, and pastries while the restaurant side (where we ate) is more fine dining. On the restaurant side, they also serve brunch, but I haven't checked that out yet.

Our waiter seemed sort of snooty, knowledgable, but definitely snooty. If we missed pronounced anything on the menu, he was sure to correct us. I'm sure it happens a lot, but I just didn't care for it. 

We ordered a ton of food on the menu, including drinks. I later learned that they have a tasting menu. I would probably opt for that in the future. 
I got Builders of Bridges for a cocktail consisting of a pineapple-Bharat shrub, vodka, and ginger beer. My boyfriend ordered the local Lebanese beer. He said it was good, nothing outrageous or too unique, but good nonetheless.  When drinks are more than $10 a pop, we usually just order one each. 

Now for the food. We ordered the warak enab (grape leaves) and fatteh (deconstructed hummus) for appetizers. The grape leaves were okay- they had great flavor and paired well with the yogurt sauce; however, they were a bit dry texturally. The fatteh, on the other thing, was probably the best thing I ate all night. 

For the main courses, we ordered the Djej meshwi (grilled chicken) and the kebab (ground lamb kebab). The grilled chicken had really good flavors that all seemed to pair well with one another. The lamb was delicious. It was really savory and very aromatic, almost a sensory overload. 

We also ordered the Lebanese Chai Latte and Tahini Hot Chocolate (super creamy, delicious, with a cotton candy-like topping) for dessert. YUM!! These were both delicious. If I could have them every day, I would. 

Honestly, I was slightly let down on the hype of Suraya. The food was good but didn't blow me away as I had expected. I'm definitely interested in going back for brunch and checking out the café side."
tRAkPy6Q_B6BtyzreWxDZQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Excellent food. They are on top of things for quality and presentation. The real problem with this place is how busy it is. Unless you get a reservation months in advance, you won't get in. They certainly don't welcome walk-ins."
Q0F8NWDoj2eGzYt5HBNjsw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Definitely a unique spot for fishtown! Not a lot of places with this eclectic array of food options. Suraya is a Lebanese/ middle eastern style restaurant. When you walk inside there is a large foyer with a coffee counter and a small gift shop with various spices, mugs, and other kitchen items. 

Came for dinner and upon reviewing the menus- I need to go for lunch because I was WAY more drawn to the lunch menu than the dinner menu. I really wanted falafel but it only appears on the lunch menu and not on the dinner menu. 

The downfall of the place was definitely the price. It was quite pricey so wouldn't be able to come here too often but definitely a good spot for special occasions. 

For appetizers, we shared the baba ganoush, the labne, and the fried kibbeh. The baba ganoush was my favorite of the three. It honestly tasted like chopped liver which I enjoy!!  My friends thought it was smokier than they were used to. The pita though....to die 

For our main courses, we had samke navyeh which was a small plate. And we had the halabi kebab - the ground lamb - it was INCREDIBLE. I would come back and only get that over and over."
K9k9hgL5ab8Sh6G3uqJjVQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Stopped in for some apps. Cooked Mushrooms, potatoes, and grape leaves. Honestly, the potatoes were the best part. They were amazing potatoes. Next time I'll stay for a full dinner."
Mv66I0PtCNJfGw96a_STQQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"This place is huge and must be used for events and dinner parties. I was a little disappointed that my entrée didn't come with a (real) side but I had enough hummous to hold me over. I ordered Shish Taouk, my chicken pieces were very meaty so I ended up taking some home, along w my side of peppers and onions. The wrap has more leaves than rice but it was a good experience, everything was good. 

Though I didn't get a drink they're made pretty. Also, you can order and pay on your phone through a website which is super cool."
5GD7itqUdVIQZuZ1ty3vVg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Fresh off of dinner last night, I wanted to get this review out there, amidst all the positively unshakeable 5 star reviews. 

Listen, Suraya is GOOOOOOOOD. The food was delicious, we were absolutely full, and the staff is suspiciously nice. The restaurant itself is beautiful, both inside and out, and service was impeccable. So why not 5 stars? 

Well, first and foremost, it is EXPENSIVE. This is a common theme you have no doubt, or will no doubt read in other reviews, but I think it bears repeating. This place does not play around with the prices. And although the food IS good, it's also basically a bunch of dips. 

Oh, which also reminds me; another reason for the not 5 stars, is that you are FORCED to eat the $65 tasting menu on Fridays and Saturdays. You ALSO don't get to pick dessert, which was weird. It was like a big, kind of sweet, but not really sweet, mozzarella stick type dish. And listen, I love fried cheese as much as the next red blooded American, but it's not something I think of when it comes to dessert. It definitely left me a little perplexed, as I couldn't decide if I liked it or hated it, so I just stopped eating it all together. Looked nice though. *shoulder shrug emoji*

Back to the cost thing; a glass of wine is $12. That's what a bottle costs in the stores. A BOTTLE of wine is like $70, which is what a CASE of wine costs in stores. A CUP OF HOT TEA, was FOUR DOLLARS!! That's hot water and a tea bag. That's like a 2000% markup. I can buy TWO BOXES; about 200 tea bags, for $4. Don't misconstrue; the food IS awesome, which is the only reason I didn't flip a table on the way out, but for what was essentially 5 dips, some middle eastern fries (the batata harra, my hands down favorite dish!), 4 little kibbeh (too minty), a piece of roasted lamb, and some chicken thigh pieces, we dropped almost $200. They don't even refill your drink. You want another orange blossom iced tea, that'll be another $4 please.

Another thing that I didn't like was that the only reservation that was available for us was 4:30, but when we got there at 4:25, we were told that they ""weren't quite ready yet,"" and we had to stand around and wait until about 4:40ish before we were sat. Not a BIG deal, but you'd think if your first reservation was 4:30, you wouldn't wait until 4:29 to get everything started. 

I don't want this review to come off negative though. Almost everything was done right, and they hit a lot of high notes too.

As I mentioned, the staff was perfect. Everyone was super nice, knowledgeable and helpful. They wore all PPE and took things seriously. I even really liked the ordering through QR code thing. I hope that sticks around after Covid!

Bottom line, I would absolutely come back to Suraya, or recommend it as a place to try, with the caveat that it's ONLY for ""special occasions."" Unless you just got it like that, and can afford to drop $250 every time you get a hankering for some baba ganoush."
PqdP9MR0b4LV5FuvE8LMYQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"the second i left this place, i texted my friends raving about how beautiful and amazing this restaurant was. this restaurant is a must try for people who live in philly

the interior decor and vibes here is AMAZZZING, they did such a good job! the bar is beautiful as well as the open kitchen. the details in the designs here is immaculate to me, but on to the important stuff, the food!

i started with a ""the nightingale"" cocktail; i felt adventurous. i love apertifs and i felt like i should try Arak since i've never tried it before. if you love licorice, you'll love this drink. it was a bit strong for me but that's just cause i'm a baby.

now on to the mezzes! i ordered 6 mezzes for 3 girls and it was the perfect amount and we got an entree. 

MUST GET MEZZE is FATTEH! it was so delicious. 

i wasn't a big fan of the fried kibbeh, it had a very strong cinnamon taste which wasn't in the description. the labne was OK, the yogurt was a bit too sour for my taste. 

the kawarma was good, not a big portion for the price but decent! it reminds me of the lamb shoulder at zahav.

i personally actually enjoy the brunch dishes WAYY more than dinner but to each his own!"
wOVR9DwM-l58eEVUSXNVgw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"High recommend for dinner - been a few times and never disappointed. 
Went for brunch today and would not recommend it. The brunch food was mediocre at best - ordered the cheese, tomato, pepper flat bread, Lebanese omelette and the shish sandwich. Whatever - the corner middle eastern store makes a better one! Also tried the Lebanese chai - it was luke warm, not strong and too sweet. It probably titillates the taste buds of people who get wowed by a cute mug with some inedible roses sprinkled on top. Skip it!"
S6FMvvNdDZg1jSSz8EOhUA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Very nice experience.  1.  Service was 5 star - Iris made our night.  Smiles sometimes outshine food.  2.  Chai and dessert; arak - chai was perfect, not too sweet as most often are.  3.  Lamb dish was unique - delicious.  4.  Cocktails - very small for price point.  12-15 is fine if volume is adequate.  Go at 5 if no reservations possible - sit at bar."
vpebBUIt6ql69931YiK6RQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Beautiful decor, fantastic service -- there's an area in the back where they let you sit with laptops and hang around after you've eaten. Not the most authentic tasting nor particularly amazing compared to other options for Middle Eastern in Philly. But a wonderful, fresh vibe for a classy experience."
iOeeeu8dDROBB9XU_KPKrg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"It's been a while sine my visit to Suraya, but the meal was memorable.  We started with the SAMKE NAYYE, which was one of the best ceviche that I've had.  It has yellowtail with chives, parsley, garlic, lemon, jalapeño, and labneh.  
We then had the BALADI, which is a black bass marinated in parsley, cilantro, and cumin.  The fish was cooked in a banana leaf and served with rice.  The fish was cooked perfectly, it was delicious.
The SAMKE HARRA was even better.  It was a whole branzino, served with a spicy tomato based sauce.  The fish was flakey, tasty and I would absolutely order it again. 

We finished our meal with the LEBANESE CHAI LATTE, which was delicious, with loads of spices and a perfect way to end a meal. 

Prices are expensive, portions are small.  Ordering the way that we did is a light meal.  I will be going again once the world opens again.  I hope its still there."
6y9Ou-K37BxiveOPfixmPA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"The hype for Suraya is real! Though I have to warn you, if you're looking for a sweet / breakfast-y brunch, I wouldn't come here. Most items are savory, lunch stuff that I could see not being the most satisfying at 11 am on a Saturday morning. Sometimes you just want bacon, eggs and some French toast - not here though. The lamb hummus was $12.50 (yikes), but I've honestly never seen lamb hummus offered anywhere else. They have hummus surrounding a decent pile of boneless lamb that you can eat with your pita. Wish the lamb hummus was offered with the platter so we could get 3 pitas but not everything can be perfect, can it? Service was so fast - we waited about 3 minutes for our Chai and Hot Chocolate, the lamb hummus came out 1 minute after (not joking) and the Chicken Wrap and Man'noush came out 4-5 minutes after. Very efficient; their kitchen is open and you can see the line-up and how there are chefs, platers and servers so props to them."
zz4_IwpF6E2Eev9LTkQRTw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I so want to give Suraya 5 stars but in good conscience, I simply can't. First off, the ambiance and interiors here are amazing--quite possibly my favorite space in the city. The front room acts as a trendy bakery/coffee shop perfect for brunch or more casual bites, the restaurant space is intimate and romantic, and the outdoor area out back feels like you've stepped into a backyard in Greece. The visual experience is unparalleled and I would pay for that alone. Unfortunately for me, every time I've visited the food has fallen just a little bit flat. I've tried the flatbreads, the hummus, the kebab platters, the sandwich and fries, the chai latte, etc., and thus far my favorite items on the menu are still the $9 pistachio yogurt and a cronut from the bakery. There's just always a little something missing...that extra ""oomph"" that makes a meal extraordinary.  The price tag seems a little high, and on our last visit they charged us an additional $3 for a piece of pita bread. Still worth a trip for the overall experience though."
6XfjKbtKAmmGDtVkf3sXLQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"This is a review for Brunch only - my suggestion would be to come back for dinner, based on what the other reviews say!  

Since Suraya opened its doors, my hubby and I have been dying to check it out - the buzz and word of mouth about the place have been nothing short of spectacular.  Needless to say, I was expecting GREAT things from Suraya when we came on a cold rainy Saturday for brunch with our friends (having made reservations about a month prior)!

Walking in, the decor is absolute perfection - the floor tiles are beautiful and ornate, the walls are adorned with tiles and artwork, and the light fixtures and furniture complete the ambiance for an intimate minimalist design with middle eastern accents and a very welcoming vibe.  There's a long gorgeous bar in the restaurant, where it seems you can order drinks and food, if you're lucky enough to snag a stool.  There's a coffee shop of sorts when you first walk through the doors - it has takeaway service, and assortments of pastries and small plates you can order to go, or to casually nosh at the few tables in the sun filled atrium.  The walls in this space are lined with shelves, proudly displaying cookbooks, spices (zaatar!), and various specialty items including jams, chocolates, teas, and more.  The prices seemed honest for the product and we almost purchased a couple things!

We had reservations (a must), but there was still about a 10 minute wait while they readied our table.  The waiting area is large and comfortable, so thankfully we weren't hovering over someone else' table while they ate. 

Finally seated, we checked out the menu, and we all promptly ordered the mimosa.  This is no ordinary mimosa - which I usually find too sweet.  This is apricot, cardamom, and brut champagne - closer to a bellini if I'm being honest.  The addition of the cardamom transformed my favorite breakfast drink (the bellini) to new heights - the sweetness was cut, and the bite from the champagne was tempered down -  this is my new favorite drink!  I'm not even ashamed to say I had two! #brunching

Our friends had been here before, and suggested a lot of our menu choices.  If we ever come back, I probably would order slightly different, but it was fun to try new things! 

We ordered a few things and shared many of the plates -
:: Hummus with slow roasted lamb (served with mint, baharat) - delicious. The hummus was creamy and delicious, the addition of the lamb added a savory, almost crunchy kick to the dish - yum!  A solid starter.
:: Beet Salad: (dandelion greens, herbs, tarator, grapefruit, cashew dukkah).  We saw this on someone else's table, and it looked delicious so we decided to give it a try.  It was refreshing, zesty, and tart.  The first couple bites were delicious, but glad we shared this 4 ways, because after a while it was a bit too overpowering on the palate.
:: Man'oushe with Za'atar, tomato, onion, and an egg - i ordered this at the urging our our friends, they were thrilled with it the last time we ordered.  A Man'oushe is a Lebanese flatbread.  It was very simple, and slightly underwhelming in my opinion, pretty bland and unexciting - this was one dish I could have done without.
:: Kafta Kebab: (Lebanese ground beef, hummus, French fries, onion, sumac, parsley).  My other half ordered this, and I ended up eating some of it.  The Kafta was really beautifully seasoned and prepared, however the wrap was very heavy and stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth.  I put some of the dandelion greens inside the wrap, which helped.  I think this could use some brightening up with fresh tomatoes, pickled onions, or some greens.  The meat was great though!

Overall, the restaurant is beautiful, the service is awesome, and I LOVE that the Philly food scene is main streaming middle eastern/mediterranean/Lebanese food.  I think the brunch menu is slightly underwhelming, and found myself thinking about some of our other favorite spots in the city.  I'll definitely be back for dinner to check out more of the menu (and maybe order that mimosa again!?), but wouldn't suggest brunch as the best way to check out Suraya."
bZOjrWM17sFHTXsOWazatg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Delicious! Not pictured is the lamb hummus we got which was AMAZING. We didn't love the espresso shots which is why it loses a star, but wow, everything here is amazing."
UzKkQ6mPQ2MiHKoU57T8bA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Giving it four because the food is excellent, but our service on the one occasion we visited was lacking overall. 

Atmosphere: beautiful place! Super spacious, super loud during busy hours. Made an 11:30 reservation for Sunday brunch. Got there like 10 minutes early and were pretty much seated right away

Food: the two of us shared the hummus with slow roasted lamb, a mana'oushe with za'atar and cheese, and the kafta kebab sandwich. The hummus came out first and quickly. The lamb, despite being roasted, had a nice crispy outside, and it was juicy and delicious and not too gamey. It was heaven combined with the smooth and flavorful hummus. The pita that accompanied the dish was fresh, warm, and fluffy. Solid hummus dish.

The kafta kebab was good, but nothing to write home about. The meat was tender, but the taste was overpowered by the seasoned (albeit delicious) fries that come inside the sandwich and on the side. 

Mana'oushe with za'atar and cheese. Delicious, like a Lebanese pizza without sauce. Warm, and tastier with every bite. In good old New Yorker style I folded the slice and it perfectly married the za'atar and cheese. I was sad this was over. 

We also ordered the coffee cake to go. We ate it back at home in jersey and it was very very fragrant and delicious, and moist.
Everything is rather affordable!

Service: Where this place could use improvement. Our waitress was a bit lackluster, took our order and never really checked in with us. We received the hummus and the sandwich, but after 30 minutes we hadn't received our flat bread. Figuring they forgot, we kept trying to flag down our waitress. We'd see her bounce around and walk fast but never really check on us. When she finally did, we advised her that we haven't received the flatbread. She didn't really apologize, but rather said she'll just go check on it. Luckily the manager came up and told us they'd comp it, which is a great way to keep customers happy. Overall though I'm bummed the order was forgotten in the first place. 

Despite this experience I can probably say with certainty that I'll be back to try other things, maybe dinner next time!"
j-8JjLI1OWKNtBDNvCcV6Q,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"This place definitely lives up to the hype. It is a pretty pricey place but the place is absolutely beautiful. I personally think the service/venue is where the charm of Suraya lies. The interior is beautiful with a open kitchen where you can see the magic happen. I went for brunch and we ordered a few different options, the Lebanese Chai and a pastry. We had wanted to try the crueler but they had just sold out of it. Service was great and very attentive, I will definitely come back!"
MEwArES3TwuIakjNGnQY2w,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Customer service- great. Everyone was attentive and made sure we had full glasses of water and that our tables were clean

Dinner- great place with an amazing flavor palate. I was a little disappointed with the amount of hummus I got for the dinner menu (and had to ask for a pita- wasn't included) with my Kafta kebab. I'd definitely come back for brunch next time since the variety of things you get seems better. 

Ambiance- elegant

Dessert- we tried the kanafeh- traditional lebanese dessert. If you have a sweet tooth, id recommend getting something else. This was more on the savory/ cheesy side. It's a very unique  flavor combination and was good, but I personally wouldn't get  it again."
x4OGVY2DSpFWvGJ0hCkWYw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,Seriously cramped tables with zero legroom marred our otherwise memorable meal. This is a popular destination for the moment and the sheer number of packed tables and staff would agree. I thought I was familiar with the flavors of the region but we were all pleasantly taken aback by the depth and richness and variety of the fare. Highly recommend the lamb dishes. Must try at least once.
RcGRr8LpJCYcntegN-pO2g,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I would give this restaurant 4.5 stars if it was possible.  This was recently rated one of the best restaurants in Philly so when I was in town on a work trip I had to try it.  Luckily I got an early same day reservation for 5:30pm on a Tuesday night for 4 of us.  The restaurant is larger than it appears from the outside and has great ambiance.  There is a small cafe in the front and the restaurant/bar is in the middle and back.  The bar is large and has several seats that wraps in a ""U"" shape.  From the moment we arrived, the service was fantastic and this continued throughout our dinner.  The menu is Lebanese focused so you have to bring people that are more adventurous eaters and appreciate that type of food.  We got several shared plates and then I had the fish special for dinner.  Everything I had was fabulous.  Prices are on par with Philly restaurants - it's not overpriced.  Would highly recommend."
H0alswi7dHWFWmDqn7c-kA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Overall great! Was a little disappointed they didn't have the falafel for dinner since we are vegetarian but the fattoush and the potatoes were very flavorful! Loved them! The hummus was good however def like the hummus at dizengoff/zahav much much more. Also the bread there as well, the one at Suraya is more crispy however that is just our taste preference.  The decor was super nice and the service was great!"
V474KYegj3twXb8X3jarlg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Fantastic service, wonderful meal and great ambiance.  Also great space and concept.  Look forward to returning soon.  Baba Ganoush is superb!!"
MT7zsgULoNUspvT1e1mp0Q,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"As a person that is usually highly critical of Middle Eastern cuisine, Suraya definitely exceeded my expectations. Came here with a group of 4 for brunch and was seated after a 15 min wait in their beautiful back room. The entire place is decorated majestically with lots of open space and warm lighting. Beautiful!

We started off with some drinks (highly recommend the lebanese chai latte and would avoid the rose lemonade) and the rose pistachio cruller. The cruller, while well made with great texture, was just a tad too sweet. I wish I had a black coffee to drink with it instead of my rose lemonade. 

This was followed with two fluffy glorious pitas and our choices of babaganoush + lamb hummus. Both were delightful and the pomegranates in the babaganoush was something I had never had before but ended up loving. Finally, we had the lahm bi-ajeen which is basically the Middle Eastern version of a pizza (but with a lot more flavor!!!) -- super satisfying but a lot smaller than I expected. If you're feeling more hungry, definitely order a second to share.

Overall, loved the restaurant and will be back for both the restaurant and the cafe right at the entrance."
Fbn6CAuUG-eDUxUYgAKrRg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I came to Suraya for breakfast on a Friday so only the flatbreads and pastries in the cafe area were available.  I ordered a half za'atar half cheese flatbread and really liked it! I was expecting the za'atar and cheese to be mixed together on the flatbread so I was a little surprised when they were separated in halves. I have to admit I liked the cheese side a tad bit more, but regardless both sides were super tasty. 

The ambiance of the place is super cute and the cafe area in particular made me want to pull out a book and sit there all day. The cafe area also has a little market to shop at as well. Overall, I really enjoyed Suraya and hope to come back for the full brunch menu one day!"
ll8UISC2NAlIdORGunRD0A,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,So I got the kafta kebab and honestly it was the best kebab I've ever had. The flavor was brilliantly intense and the herbs packed quite a punch- loved it! Pita was pretty good and hummus was tasty also. The roasted veggies were a bit acidic but still solid. I just did not like service- the mobile scan order system was having a lot of issues. Our pita and water also came like 20 minutes late which was unfortunate. I think the food itself warrants a 5 star but hopefully the service is better next time.

Not running back"
laQb7nAZEB3AAwVKbQeqQw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,Beautiful restaurant with delicious food. Only thing I'd change is to add more vegetarian/vegan options
LGX2c1BEBbqY55DTYVrPyA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"i've been here for dinner before and i couldn't really understand all of the hype - but their brunch menu is amazing!

i'd encourage ordering a few different things and enjoying them family-style. each of the dishes we ordered really complemented each other and i definitely appreciated the variety on the table. i think if i had just ordered a baba ganoush for myself, it would have felt like an incomplete meal... or demolish a hummus by yourself for breakfast, whatever floats your boat!

i'd highly recommend any of the following: their pistachio ma'amoul, za'atar / onion / tomato flatbread, baba ganoush with pita, and tehina yogurt. the tehina yogurt in particular is just spectacular!

we had the shish taouk kebab plate as well, and it wasn't bad, but i'd probably order a flatbread over this item when we go back for brunch someday."
fHqaQ_ZLC63W5GZk4lcgsQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"The place is beautiful. They did a great job with the design. It has a full restaurant, cafe area, and a full bar where you can sit and have a drink. They also have a parking area across the street to help with the stress of parking in Fishtown. I usually go in for the pastries and coffee which is awesome."
9SuCrrDB5Np5_Xk-4W1wig,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Adorable ambiance, bustling place, they were packed and didn't have a single reservation open but they still got three of us in immediately at the bar! My friends said their drinks were good and we got breakfast platters that were great."
wK8ANwcKZgviCykJdPOgiQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Three dishes here are five stars, and the rest are just three. I'm a little surprised this was rated the #1 restaurant by Philly mag, but I will say I'd definitely come back for these three dishes only:

- the babganoush: creamy, perfectly balanced in smokiness and sweetness, sprinkled with pomegranates, divine on the hot pita bread, it lives up to the raves

- the chai latte: creamy, foamy, sprinkled with rose petals, totally divine, order this the moment you sit down 

- the cheese-rose water dessert: I forget the exact name but this blew me away with its crispy, toasted edges, cheesy and warm interior, and pistachio-topped crust, impeccably made

The rest of the dishes were disappointing. That Fatteh dish everyone raves about? Yeesh! Such a bizarre, crunchy concoction with a confusing consistency and too-sweet taste. 

The lamb dish with the cinnamon was way too spiced and off-putting, and the hummus was forgettable. 

Also wouldn't recommend the tahini hot chocolate. The best part is the cotton candy they top it with (delicious!), but once that's eaten, you're stuck with an expensive Nestle-tasting drink.

Just stick with those three dishes and you'll have a five-star meal."
RgZijvKScSYqNfthDbTjzg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"When I walked into the restaurant I was blown away by the decor and ambiance. I continued walking to my designated table and peeked into their outdoor dining and baybeeeeeeee..... it was such a vibe that I told myself that the next time I come here I need to get that outdoor seating. Our waitress was nice and explained to us that the ordering is done through the QR code-easy-peasy. We decided to order Samke Nayyeh(yellowfish) and it was good. I personally do not eat raw fish so it's not within my palate, nevertheless, good flavor. Batata Harra (potatoes)-they were crispy and flavorful. Warak Enab (stuffed grape leaves)- they were warm and I likes- I do prefer a little more seasoning. We also ordered Dry Aged Rib Eye (for 2) and it was delicious. We ordered medium but I think we were served a medium-rare instead, which was still okay. The steak came with roasted potatoes, hummus, baba ganoush, and wth toum(delish!). Last, We ordered tumeric rice,  which again, I wished had a little more flavor. The rosewater lemonade was refreshing!

This place is sucha vibe and def good for a date night!"
XCQloVep7OCe-x-s-iLOng,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Suraya will now always hold a special place in my heart as it's the dinner we had immediately after my boyfriend proposed to me!! So many special memories with our meal from Suraya :) 

We have been wanting to try Suraya for a while, but finally found a time to check it out during my most recent visit to PHL. Of course, COVID precautions made this a tiny bit difficult, but thankfully, Suraya has an extensive takeout menu, so we were able to order the ""Taste of Suraya for 2"" to get a little taste of everything. We placed our order a few days before, and pickup was super smooth - didn't even have to go inside the restaurant, as they had the front opened up in the beautiful weather! Really appreciate their accommodations during these weird times and their maintenance of appropriate precautions while still serving their dishes!

The ""Taste"" started off with a hefty serving of hummus, baba ganoush, and labneh. The hummus was definitely incredibly creamy, and the labneh had a smooth, refreshing taste that paired well with the saltiness of the olives. The baba ganoush was the standout in my opinion though - just the right amount of spice that was balanced by the inclusion of pomegranate seeds. A nice combination! This was all paired with some pita, which was nothing to really write home about - pretty standard stuff. In hindsight, probably should have ordered extra pita to soak up these apps, but we made do with what we had. For our mains, I went with the branzino and my BF with the lamb. We were so full from the mezza that we barely touched our mains, but we did really enjoy them. The branzino was cooked perfectly and nicely paired with a little bit of a spicy tomato sauce that was balanced by walnuts and pine nuts. The sauce was semi-pureed, but I just wish it had some fuller tomatoes and/or peppers alongside it. You can tell the lamb is a signature dish - the flavors were so unique and classic Lebanese, really showcasing Suraya. We loved the hints of cinnamon in the dish, and the fire-roasted peppers and tomatoes were the perfect accompaniment to the lamb. Truly a nice dish! We rounded out the meal with the linzer bar + chocolate/almond financier - these were both new desserts to me, but they were so delicious. The linzer bar was almost like a crumb cake with a fruit jam on it - crumbled in your mouth but had that nice sweetness from the jam mixed in. The financier reminded me of a flourless chocolate cake - such rich, dense flavor that really stuck with you and was so decadent. We were so full from these alone that we didn't touch the ashta, but when I did enjoy it a few days later, it was also very tasty. A refreshing dessert, it was almost like a milk pudding with some pound cake, strawberries, and rhubarb mixed in. Not overly sweet, but very refreshing and perfect for the summer!

For the price, we got a TON of food to last us a few days! We did wish the hummus had a little something extra to help it standout, and we would definitely suggest ordering extra pita to soak up the goodness. We truly enjoyed our takeout dinner from Suraya, and we will always remember this meal we shared! We definitely want to make it back in person to dine in the garden and other menu items - looking forward to getting the full experience very soon! Thanks for such wonderful, delicious memories, Suraya!"
N3MAecjy9VAGV4nBVgtaVw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,Nice place with good ambience. Flat bread was incredible and so was the mule. Chicken was bit dry.

We went for a Sunday brunch. Will visit in evening next time just for ambience. Food was fresh but pretty bland according to me"
2DF9XE8WfaqahubbJduMrQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Everyone has been raving about this restaurant so I just had to try it! I will say, I WAS a little disappointed, but with it being COVID and take out I'm hoping that was why. Here's what we ordered:
- Fried Kibbeh - these dumplings were reallyyy dry. There wasn't enough of the mint-cucumber yogurt sauce with it to help combat that
- Halabi kebab - lamb kebab...good but nothing crazy to write home about. This came with a babyyyy amount of hummus which was a little disappointing. Hummus was average and the pita with it, I could have bought it from the grocery store. Nothing set it apart. 
- Samke Harra - the branzino was expected, but the sauce, holy moly load me more of that. It was amazing. Came with turmeric rice which was meh. 
- Sumac French fries with toum - HOLY COW. These babies stole the show. You're thinking, getting fries at a Levantine restaurant..really? YES REALLY. They were amazing - big, crispy, flavorful. I would go back just for these

Overall it was a decent meal but not the wow I expected. Will go back in hopes the COVID takeout is what did them in."
qXpWOXXO_vJrpg_OY1yVYw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"It's stunning and unexpected. When you walk-in off Frankford Ave, you are transported to Turkey or Morocco. Tiles and light look authentic! Wonderful unique pastries and middle eastern coffees. They have a beautiful bar then an open hearth further in the restaurant . The space is open and very large. The savory items look great and I'll be back soon to try them. It's open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. What a great edition not only to the neighborhood but to the city. An absolute must try."
66U6AKr2vsucuwQVVCd97w,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I've only ever had the chance to sit at the bar here. 

The hostess informed me that all of the tables were booked through the rest of the night so I presume getting a reservation here might be a little difficult. 

The people were friendly and the bartender was knowledgeable about the menu. Food arrived pretty quickly and was delicious. 

The atmosphere is quite charming, very open and spacious. They also have a great courtyard in the back along with heaters for the winter. 

The wine beer and cocktail selection was pretty good. But also, they have a full bar so you can pretty much ask for anything.  

I like the area and would recommend to a friend."
Xkbgq0DOryzIdjH8EKskBg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"I am excited to have Suraya in the neighborhood. Staff was very friendly, decor is beautiful, and the cafe counter is well stocked with delicious looking treats. Unfortunately, I won't be visiting too frequently since the cafe is a bit expensive - the cruller and a mint tea, although a heavenly combination for the taste buds, was hard on the wallet ($9). I am excited to try out the restaurant when it opens in 2018 and then revisit for special occasions."
r1HddjZ3LCnSSaLVvJpn2g,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,Lovely lovely place!!! Atmosphere is amazing and love the outside part. Came for lunch which was great!! Hummus was good and flatbread was delicious!
MmvzCDhBDCR1T-snMhjZvQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Came in on a friend's recommendation while I was visiting from out of state. The decor and atmosphere is very clean. I love the open kitchen concept. 

I've been to plenty of places during COVID, so it's nice to see how many places share the same ideas. Such as menus scanned from QR codes, along with ordering via an app or website. There are a few hurdles at times though with these though. Suraya falls under the same. 

Upon being seated, we were greeted, with who seemed to be our waiter. He provided us water to start and answered our questions. One being how do we order drinks if they aren't on the menu? Like a whiskey neat or a skinny margarita. Our waiter asked the bartender how he would like it to be done. However, although the skinny margarita was able to be executed on the website, the whiskey neat needed to be verbally told to the bartender. Another minor thing, which I thought was odd, was the delivery of one drink at a time, even though they were just a minute or so apart.

The food was very good, but as new dishes came, any mess that was made by us on the table, such as fallen hummus and such weren't cleaned up. We had to ask for it to be cleaned. It didn't seem as though there was some confusion on who does what and when at times. 

With all the food we had, we couldn't finish it all so we needed boxes. During COVID it's hit or miss who boxes/plates the remaining food. At Suraya, they provided containers for patrons to box up their remaining food. 

Overall it's a nice place to have some nibbles and a drink or two."
SWv73F3nH-wOXwb1GkmcGQ,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"My boyfriend and I visited Suraya for Sunday brunch and it did not disappoint! 

I ordered the Baba Ganoush based on popular reviews. The hummus was not bad. The pomegranate seeds were a necessity in this dish; it added that hint of sweetness that a balanced out the rest of the flavors. Pita was plentiful enough to compliment the hummus. 

My boyfriend ordered the Kebab Platter. The fries with garlic sauce was definitely the star if this plate for me! Everything else was pretty satisfying too. 

My favorite part of this meal would have to be the Lebanese Chai tea. It was like a cozy holiday in a cup. So warm, intimate and comforting. 

The ambience and decor was absolutely beautiful. I would definitely return for dinner!"
cISuzx6xnqRum8LkGi1cmA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"When meeting a friend in Philly for lunch, we decided to try something new. We went on a Monday around 11:30. Parking was a pain but you can find free parking. Upon walking inside, I was surprised how light the place felt. You walk into the cafe part of the restaurant and are welcomed with a case of fresh baked goods, a barista area and plenty of tables for coffee chats and getting work done. 

We were seated right away. They have a courtyard outside for seating in the back but since it was so hot we stayed inside. Next to our table were this little window box which were such a creative touch. I also loved how open, and giant, the kitchen is. You can watch everything going on. The bar is also very large and you can eat there. The tile around the bar is beautiful. 

Our waitress was wonderful and took the time to explain all the dishes, answer our many questions and give recommendations. I ended up ordering the  ful mudammas with a side of falafel and my friend got the lamb hummus with a side of crudité. Everything was incredibly delicious and I loved the giant pita bread that comes with the dishes. 

I must say that the acoustics of this place are amazing. It got pretty crowded as the lunch hour moved on and you could barely hear the other tables. I loved that! 

We wanted to order some pastries after our meal to go with our coffee but I was so bummed to find out that they were out of almost everything.  I'm wondering why they didn't make more considering it was only lunch time and they open at 11. I guess order pastries first before food to ensure you get some?!! I hope to come back and try more food on the menu and the chai. Hopefully I'll get to try the backed goods too. Overall, delicious food and great service!"
BvpLFTghqOhDIg6RUbE_LA,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"The place is beautiful! The outside area was very nice and the service was very good . It had a very cool vibe too ! The food was good-- the beet salad was excellent --fresh greens , herbs and roasted beets. The chick pea hummus and the pita was DELICIOUS ! I would have given it five stars but onion and tomato za'tar was way too salty . However, I highly recommend it to anyone who has not been."
CpVJhqyajxMdnxjF7OwDbg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Super chic and lovely environment. As someone who has been a huge fan of Cafe La Maude (their sister restaurant) I was super excited for this to open! Though I wasn't the biggest fan of their dinner the first time I went (Zahav offers very similar but better tasting options for much lower price) I have to say they may offer the best brunch in the city! Their drink menu is also spectacular along with their little retail section with the cutest cup sets available for purchase. I do however wish they would allow for more modifications as someone with dietary restricts it is frustrating when restaurants in 2019 are not more accommodating. 

Overall, thoroughly enjoyed my brunch experience at Suraya and will definitely be back."
CJSlvQR3MLb5Kmg533OHgg,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Delicious pastries and Stumptown coffee. Beautiful interior and decor. Can't wait for the dinner service and outdoor courtyard to open... the courtyard is expansive and will be beautiful in warmer weather! The pastries are a bit pricey, as two coffees and two pastries cost about $20, but they tasted delicious and were fresh and well executed."
siE44d917l30Q8NozGiztw,vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,4.0,"Suraya is very good. Make a reservation ahead of time because you'll have a very hard time getting a table. Parking can be dicey so take an Uber or Lyft.

When you walk in you notice it's a huge space with tons of space, it's artfully decorated.  We started off with the hummus and the chicken livers.  Honestly the hummus was just fine, nothing remarkable but the chicken livers were divine and a must try. It's served in a rich pomegranate molasses sauce that accents the richness of the livers. 

From there we ordered the dry aged ribeye that's for two. It comes alongside a multitude of condiments and grilled veggies. It's perfection and worth the meat sweats that are sure to come. 

The kunefe is too much on the cheesy side than having an even ratio of noodles to cheese but its solid. Visit suraya you wont be sad"
